<h2 id="_introduction">Introduction</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This book is my second effort at writing down everything I know about APIs. <em>Build APIs You Wont Hate</em> was essentially every complicated design I had to navigate when building an API for a mobile-centric startup that was basically a combination of Foursquare, Groupon, and Instragram. I had to think about naming endpoints, writing documentation for designers, shaping the response body JSON, was curious about which status codes to use, etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then after the initial ebook was released in 2014 I went on to work at a carpooling company that had a few APIs, with folks spread out all over the world. That helped me understand the need for HATEOAS (explained later) a whole lot more, as we were inferring state in all sorts of weird ways and getting it wrong a lot. The folks on that team also helped me learn loads about various forms of integration testing, load testing, standards like JSON:API, and a whole lot more.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The original book was just my attempt to help readers navigate complex decisions, decide between alternative approaches, outline the potential pitfalls of various strategies, etc., but these days when I read things I wrote back then it feels dated. Even though I don&#8217;t feel like much of it was outright incorrect, I do disagree with many of the conclusions I came to back then. Modern-day Phil writing this in 2019 has a lot more information to go on.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Beyond the gaps in my knowledge, so much has changed in API land between 2014 and 2019. For a while a lot of these changes were incremental and I could just update the book a little for the ebook readers, or expand things with a blog post. Now I feel like the time has come to start from scratch and write a new book, because having people read a whole book then 35+ articles just felt a little silly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Back in 2014, a lot of folks (myself included) were acting like REST was the only way to do things, and older systems like SOAP (or anything RPC-based) were bad and silly. These days RPC in the form of gRPC or GraphQL is all the rage, and some people are acting like REST is bad and silly. Comically at that time most of us were building "RESTish" APIs anyway due to lack of understanding in the benefits of HATEOAS, and REST without HATEOAS is basically RPC with pretty URLs. When 99% of the API developers out there discuss REST vs RPC it&#8217;s a fairly moot point, because they&#8217;re talking about essentially the same thing until they learn the strengths and weakness of both paradigms correctly. This book will help unfurl this mess.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another huge change in HTTP-land is HTTP/2 becoming considerably more available, and viable as a choice. Back when I was writing <em>Build APIs You Wont Hate</em>, nothing much supported HTTP/2. This made it feel more like more of an academic concept, which we could look forward to, but not actually use yet. Now most web servers, several languages, and a whole bunch of frameworks support it, either fully or mostly. The only thing holding API developers back from more usage is education and momentum. HTTP/2 changes pretty much everything about API design, so we need to look at it a lot more closely. It fundamentally changes how you design everything, as the sort of things you find yourself trying to solve in HTTP/1.1 at the application level are handled for you so much more seamlessly in HTTP/2.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the past a lot of the API specification tools being used for HTTP-based APIs were&#8230;&#8203; fairly bad. Folks were just using them for documentation (if that), and often using annotation-based approaches, because the tooling out there to help design specifications didn&#8217;t exist. Nobody wants to write a bunch of JSON/YAML by hand, so we just skipped it all, and maybe wrote some docs later, or maybe just didn&#8217;t bother. Now API Specification tooling has grown so much its almost unrecognizable.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Previously I&#8217;d recommend people think about their resources, which helps guide which endpoints we need, then jump right into creating serializers to output data, then we start writing the code to populate those serializers. These days I&#8217;d flip that entirely, and start with API specifications first, then use those specifications to build mock servers to get client feedback early, then use those specifications as contracts for contract testing on API responses, and a whole lot more.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So, the times have changed, and the approach for this book will feel a bit different to readers of the last. For example, as well as learning about REST properly (which few books have done in a way easy enough for the majority of developers to understand), we&#8217;re going to learn about the other two popular technologies: GraphQL and gRPC. Many chapters will be broken down into sections which explain how certain things work for each of these technologies, so you can understand and compare the differences, or skip sections if you are not interested in using those technologies.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another big difference will be a lack of sample application code. The previous book was basically "How to build RESTish APIs with Laravel" with a lot of theory and occasional code samples for other languages. If you are looking for a "How to build gRPC APIs with Go" or "How to build GraphQL APIs with Erlang" or any other language or technology specific guide, then this book is not going to be for you. We are going to cover REST, gRPC and GraphQL equally, we&#8217;re going to use examples from various languages, and there will not be a "build along with us as you code" or example application bundled with the book, as they get outdated too fast and keeping book code up to date for a decade is not enjoyable or realistic.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So, settle in, and lets learn a whole bunch of stuff about building APIs!</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If APIs are the interface for some sort of service, it should not come as a surprise that not all the interfaces in the world are going to have the same needs and requirements. Most of them are a case of "execute a command", "interact with data", or a combination of both.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are three distinct types of Web API which handles these common needs, and these different types are known as paradigms. To oversimplify things a bit, it’s reasonably fair to say that all APIs conform to one of these paradigms:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>RPC (Remote Procedure Call)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>REST (Representational State Transfer)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Query Languages</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These paradigms are general approaches to building APIs, not a specific tool or specification. They are merely an idea or set of ideas, not a tangible thing. For that, we need to look at implementations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Implementations</strong> are something you can actually download, install, and use to build an API, that conforms to whatever rules the implementors picked, from whichever paradigm (or paradigms) they were interested in at the time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Specifications</strong> (or standards, recommendations, etc.) are often drafted up by various working groups, to help implementations share functionality in the same way. An API and a client in different languages can work together perfectly if they’re all following the specification correctly. The difference between a standard and a specification is usually just down to who made it. When a working group like the IETF or W3C create something, it&#8217;s a standard, but when Google knock something out on their own, it&#8217;s a specification.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>SOAP is a W3C recommendation, following the RPC paradigm, with implementations like gSOAP</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>gRPC is an implementation, following the RPC paradigm, which has no standard defined by any working group, but authors Google Inc. did document the protocol in a specification</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>REST is a paradigm, which has never been turned into a specification, and has no official implementations, but building a REST API is usually just a case of picking appropriate standards and tooling</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Making direct comparisons between any of these things is tough because it should be possible to see that paradigms, implementations and specifications are all rather different. We&#8217;ll be covering all the paradigms, and we will be looking at how things work in a few of the more popular implementations throughout the book.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First, let us try and figure out the main conceptual differences between the paradigms.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_remote_procedure_call_rpc">Remote Procedure Call (RPC)</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>RPC is the earliest, simplest form of API interaction. It is about executing a block of code on another server, and when implemented in HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) or Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) it can become a Web API. There is a method and some arguments, and that is pretty much it. Think of it like calling a function in JavaScript, taking a method name and arguments.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>POST /sayHello HTTP/1.1
HOST: api.example.com
Content-Type: application/json

{"name": "Racey McRacerson"}</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In JavaScript, the equivalent concept is defining a function, and calling it elsewhere:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript">/* Signature */
function sayHello(name) {
  // ...
}

/* Usage */
sayHello("Racey McRacerson");</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The idea is the same. An API is built by defining public methods; then, the methods are called with arguments. RPC is just a bunch of functions, but in the context of an HTTP API, that entails putting the method in the URL and the arguments in the query string or body.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When used for CRUD ("Create, Read, Update, Delete"), RPC is just a case of sending up and down data fields. This can be fine, but it also means the client is in charge of pretty much everything. The client must know which methods to hit, and at what time, in order to construct its own workflow out of a bevy of methods, with only human interaction or written interactions to help the client application developer figure out what to do and in which order. That might be a positive, or a negative, depending on what sort of relationship you want your clients and servers to have.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>RPC is without doubt the most prominent paradigm used in API land, possibly because it feels so natural to many programmers. Calling a function locally and calling a function remotely feel so similar, that it just clicks with a lot of developers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That said, there are a few other things to figure out, like should the method name go in the URL, or should it be passed in the body. Should it be entirely POST or a combination of GET and POST? Should we use metadata to describe what the payload data is? To answer questions like this, RPC has a whole bunch of specifications, all of which have concrete implementations:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<div class="title">Older popular RPC standards</div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>XML-RPC</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>JSON-RPC</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>XML-RPC and JSON-RPC are not used all that much other than by a minority of entrenched fanatics, but SOAP is still kicking around for a lot of financial services and corporate systems like Salesforce.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>XML-RPC was problematic, because ensuring data types of XML payloads is tough. In XML, a lot of things are just strings, which JSON does improve, but has trouble differentiating different data formats like integers and decimals.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You need to layer metadata on top in order to describe things such as which fields correspond to which data types. This became part of the basis for SOAP, which used XML Schema and a WSDL (Web Services Description Language) to explain what went where and what it contained.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This metadata is essentially what most science teachers drill into you from a young age: "label your units!". The sort of thing that stops people paying $100 for something that should have been $1 but was just marked as <code>price: 100</code> which was meant to be cents&#8230;&#8203;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All three of these specifications had implementations created by various people, mostly as open-source projects. Occasionally the folks who put the standard together created an official implementation in their favourite language, and the community built their own in other languages they wanted to use.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A modern RPC specification is gRPC, which can easily be considered modern SOAP. It uses a data format called Protobuf, which requires a schema file as well as the data instance, much like the WSDL in SOAP. This Protobuf file is shared with both the client and the server, and then messages can be verified and passed between the server and client in binary, which leads to smaller messages than passing around big chunks of JSON.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>gRPC focuses on making single RPC interactions, and it aims to achieve this as quickly as possible, thanks to the aforementioned binary benefits, and its other huge benefit: HTTP/2. All of the gRPC implementations are HTTP/2 by default, and usually handle this with their own built-in web server to make sure HTTP/2 works the whole way through the transaction.</p>
</div>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_representational_state_transfer_rest">Representational State Transfer (REST)</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>REST is a network paradigm described by Roy Fielding in a dissertation in 2000. REST is all about a client-server relationship, where server-side data are made available through representations of data in simple formats. This format is usually JSON or XML but could be anything (including Protobuf).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These representations portray data from various sources as simple "resources", or "collections" of resources, which are then potentially modifiable with actions and relationships being made discoverable via a concept known as HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State). That&#8217;s a rough acronym that confuses folks, so many API people just use the term "Hypermedia Controls" to mean the same thing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Hypermedia controls are fundamental to REST. It is merely the concept of providing "next available actions", which could be related data, or more often it&#8217;s actions available for that resource in its current state, like having a "pay" option for an invoice that has not yet been paid.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These actions are just links, but the idea is the client knows that an invoice is payable by the presence of a "pay" link, and if that link is not there it should not show that option to the end user.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript">{
  "data": {
    "type": "invoice",
    "id": "093b941d",

    }
  },
  "links": {
    "pay": "https://api.acme.com/invoices/093b941d/payment_attempts"
  }
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is quite different to RPC. Imagine the two approaches were humans answering the phones for a doctors office:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Client:</strong> Hi, I would like to speak to Dr Watson, is he there?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>RPC:</strong> No. <strong>click</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Client calls back</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Client:</strong> I found his calendar and luckily I know how to interact with the Google Calander API. I have checked his availability, and it looks like he is off for the day. I would like to visit another doctor, and it looks like Dr Jones is available at 3pm, can I see her then?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>RPC:</strong> Yes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The burden of knowing what to do is entirely on the client, and this can lead to "fat clients" (i.e: the client contains a lot of business logic). It needs to know all the data, come to the appropriate conclusion itself, then has to figure out what to do next.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>REST, however, presents you with the next available options:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Client:</strong> Hi, I would like to speak to Dr Watson, is he there?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>REST:</strong> Doctor Watson is not currently in the office, he’ll be back tomorrow, but you have a few options. If it’s not urgent you could leave a message and I’ll get it to him tomorrow, or I can book you with another doctor, would you like to hear who is available today?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Client:</strong> Yes, please let me know who is there!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>REST:</strong> Doctors Smith and Jones, here are links to their profiles.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Client:</strong> Ok, Doctor Jones looks like my sort of Doctor, I would like to see them, let’s make that appointment.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>REST:</strong> Appointment created, here’s a link to the appointment details.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>REST provided all of the relevant information with the response, and the client was able to pick through the options to resolve the situation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>None of this is magic, no client is going to know exactly what to do without being trained, but the client of a REST API can be told to follow the <code>"alternative_doctors": "https://api.example.com/available_doctors?available_at=2017-01-01 03:00:00 GMT"`</code> link. That is far less of a burden on the client than expecting it to check the calendar itself, seek for availability, etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This centralization of state into the server has benefits for systems with multiple different clients who offer similar workflows. Instead of distributing all the logic, checking data fields, showing lists of "Actions", etc. around various clients — who might come to different conclusions — REST keeps it all in one place.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This book will get more in-depth on hypermedia controls later. There are a few other important things to understand about REST APIs first:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>REST must be stateless: not persisting sessions between requests</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Responses should declare cacheablility: helps your API scale if clients respect the rules</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>REST focuses on uniformity: if you’re using HTTP you should utilize HTTP features whenever possible, instead of inventing conventions</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These constraints of REST when applied to HTTP APIs can help the API last for decades, which is a whole lot more complex without these concepts. What does that mean? Well, REST is often described as a series of layers of abstraction on top of RPC, with all relevant instructions related to the handling of that message being baked into the message itself, to avoid having to tell a human about specific ways to handle things. As things change throughout the entire ecosystem, a well trained REST API and client should be able to handle those changes seamlessly, because the REST API is describing itself well and the client is listening. This loosens the coupling found in other paradigms, where a lot of that is baked into the client itself.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some folks look at all this and do not understand why REST requires "all the extra faffing about". There are many who just do not quite get the point of any of it, and consider RPC to be the almighty. To them, it is all about executing the remote code as fast possible, but REST (which can still absolutely be performant) focuses far more on longevity and reduced client-coupling instead. Knowing when to have a fat client and when to have a skinny client is a powerful decision making process to have in your arsenal, so definitely do not be one of those people who things it should always be A, or always be B.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another interesting thing about REST is that it does not require the use of schema metadata (like WSDL or similar), but does allow it. In fact, REST has no opinions either way: it does not explicitly demand it, nor disallow it. the metadata is something many API developers hated about SOAP, and from 2015 to current day, it has become more and more of a growing trend once again, thanks to gRPC and GraphQL including and requiring type systems in their implementations. the HTTP community (building REST or whatever) has a few type systems available for optional use, the main one these days being: JSON Schema.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>JSON Schema is inspired by XML Schema — but not functionally identical — and is one of the most important things to happen to HTTP APIs in years, and will be discussed a lot throughout the book.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Unfortunately, REST became a marketing buzzword for most of 2006–2014. It became a metric of quality that developers would aspire to, fail to understand, then label as REST anyway. Most systems saying they are REST are little more than RPC with HTTP verbs and pretty URLs. As such, you might not get cacheability provided, it might have a bunch of wacky conventions, and there might not be any links for you to use to discover next available actions. These APIs are jovially called REST<em>ish</em> by people aware of the difference.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>REST has no specification which is what leads to some of this confusion, nor does it have concrete implementations. That said, there are two large popular specifications which provide a whole lot of standardization for various aspects of REST APIs that chose to use them:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>JSON:API</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>OData</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the API advertises itself as using one of these, you will be able to find a whole bunch of tooling that will work out of the box with this API, meaning you can get going quicker. Otherwise you will have to go at it yourself with a common HTTP client, which is fine with a little bit of elbow grease.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This book will look more at these two formats and others, as they are hugely important for avoiding bikeshedding over the implementation of trivial features and already solved problems.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_query_languages">Query Languages</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Query languages are designed to give huge flexibility to the client, to make very specific requests, beyond a few simple arguments. Imagine a client asking for an a RPC endpoint to create a very specific report, like asking for a list of companies with unpaid invoices in the last 3 months. You would end up with <code>POST /getCompaniesByUnpaidRecently("&gt;= 3 months")</code> or something very specific.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A good query language lets the client treat the API like a data store, and do whatever it wants -within its permissions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are more query languages out there than there are amateur food bloggers at a NYC restaurant opening, but only some of them specifically aim to solve things for Web APIs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, you could probably take some standard SQL, pipe it over an HTTP endpoint <code>POST /sql</code> and call it an API, but you probably don&#8217;t want to do that for a few thousand reasons.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_sparql_2008">SPARQL (2008)</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First released in 2008 and finally making it to be a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/">W3C Recommendation</a> in 2013, SPARQL sets out to handle some rather complex queries.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>SELECT ?human ?humanLabel
WHERE
{
	?human wdt:P31 wd:Q5 .       #find humans
	?human rdf:type wdno:P40 .   #with at least one P40 (child) statement defined to be "no value"
	SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language "[AUTO_LANGUAGE],en" }
}</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another one popped up in 2008 called FIQL, which is a little easier to parse by human and by computer.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>title==foo*;(updated=lt=-P1D,title==*bar)</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here is an example looking for a title beginning with "foo", and which has either been updated in the last day, or has a title ending with "bar". That&#8217;s a powerful query for such a simple syntax.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You could easily imagine shoving this into a query string:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>/games?filter= + urlencode("title==foo*;(updated=lt=-P1D,title==*bar)")</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This made it to an <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-nottingham-atompub-fiql-00">IETF Draft</a>, but never became a final standard.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There were other query languages floating around too, but none of those attempts to create query languages ever really made it into the mainstream. Their usage seemed mostly restricted to academic purposes, with folks in universities, libraries, etc., all finding interesting uses, but there are no popular content management systems built around them, and we certainly didn&#8217;t see the major tech players, and hot new startups, or anyone really building out things using these query languages.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There was one exception to that, and Facebook actually did have a lesser-known query language based API called FQL (not FIQL). It was their own implementation, they never open-sourced any of it, and despite being a bit weird to work with it was really useful for edge cases that a normal API might not quite be able to answer. You could make a query like "Get me an avatar for all of my friends who live in the UK" or "What is the surname of everyone I know who has a Pet" or any other arbitrary query that popped into your head.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>GET /fql?q=SELECT uid2 FROM friend WHERE uid1=me()&amp;access_token=abc123</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Facebook got a bit fed up with having a RESTish approach to get data, and then having the FQL approach for more targeted queries as well, as they both require different code. As such, they ended up creating a middle-ground between "endpoint-based APIs" (a term they use to group REST/RESTish) and FQL. This middle-ground solution was known as GraphQL, which was released publicly as a specification with a few official implementations in 2015.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>GraphQL is essentially a RPC-based query language system, where the client is required to ask for specific resources, and also list the specific fields they are interested in receiving back. The GraphQL API will then return only those fields in the response.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Facebook chose to ignore most of the conventions of the transportation layer (HTTP), meaning they had full control over the concepts. Endpoints are gone, resources are gone, HTTP methods are gone (everything is just a POST to a single endpoint), resources declaring their own cacheability is gone, the concept of the uniform interface (as REST defines it) is obliterated. All of this has the advertised benefit of making GraphQL portable enough that it could fit into AMQP, or any other transportation protocol which is something REST could theoretically do but nobody ever bothers with due to the amount of crowbarring it would take.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>GraphQL has many fantastic features and benefits, which are all bundled in one package, with a nice marketing site. If you are trying to learn how to make calls to a GraphQL API, the <a href="http://graphql.org/learn/">Learn GraphQL</a> documentation will help, and their site has a bunch of other resources.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Seeing as GraphQL was built by Facebook, who had previously built a REST<em>ish</em> API, they’re familiar with various REST/HTTP API concepts. Many of those existing concepts were used as inspiration for GraphQL functionality, or carbon copied straight into GraphQL.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The main selling point of GraphQL is that it defaults to providing the very smallest response from an API, as you are requesting only the specific bits of data that you want, which minimizes the Content Download portion of the HTTP request.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It also reduces the number of HTTP requests necessary to retrieve data for multiple resources, known as the "HTTP N+1 Problem" that has been a problem for API developers through the lifetime of HTTP/1.1. Basically a lot of RPC APIs - and poorly designed REST APIs - would give you a list of resources in the first request, but then to get further information clients would need to make another request for each resource. This means for a list with 10 resources, the client would need to make 11 (1+10) requests to fetch everything it needed. This has been the bane of HTTP/1.1 developers for years, but GraphQL has provided one consistent solution to this via fetching multiple resources in a single request, very similar to how JSON:API and OData have done in the past.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>GraphQL is a strong and relatively simple solution to the majority of issues that Web API developers ran into in a HTTP/1.1 world, with clients who do not care about Hypermedia Controls. Their optimizations and the way they&#8217;ve built their own conventions inside HTTP mean they&#8217;re kinda stuck unable to leverage HTTP/2 fully, and comically when folks design their APIs with HTTP/2 in mind, most of what GraphQL is aiming to do actually hurts the clients, and makes things slower. A lot of folks see it as REST 2.0, but that is probably down to the marketing hype machine, and not down to education.</p>

<h2 id="_part_two_planning_design">Part Two: Planning &amp; Design</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When I was younger and dumber, the planning stage for APIs was pretty much "think of a list of endpoints then start coding" which is wildly insufficient. As the <a href="#theory-contracts">API Contracts</a> chapter explained, contracts are incredibly important throughout the life-cycle of an API. We are going to look into how they can be used in the planning and design stage.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most of the planning and design phase is intended to do two things:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Make developers think really hard about the requirements for their API</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gather feedback from clients application developers</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Poorly planned APIs waste a lot of time and money for a lot of people. I&#8217;ve seen APIs go from v1 to v2 in the first few months after the clients noticed it didn&#8217;t actually work properly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You need that feedback early on, with minimal effort from the API developers, and description languages let that happen. The least effort with most reward is to write some OpenAPI/JSON Schema/Protobuf/etc files, turn those into documentation, mock servers, or even sandbox servers, then get feedback on those interfaces.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Feedback is then a simple case of tweaking those files, with no need to change a bunch of code, fix a bunch of tests, etc. Once the interface is agreed upon, the code can then just be written to make that interface work as explained in the contract.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is much closer to the Agile workflow, instead of the Waterfall model. Waterfall is junk for API development.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>TODO: Diagram of waterfall model showing API development, two clients development, feedback.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So, how do we create documentation from our contracts, and what the hell are mock servers anyway?

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Throughout the planning phase, all the API developers involved, other folks on your team, and potential clients are going to want to see how this API is going to work. Thankfully you have chosen to write down how it all works with contracts, so this will be easy.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All we need to do is turn those contract files (probably <code>.json</code>, <code>.yaml</code>, <code>.proto</code>, .etc) into some human-readable documentation for them to point their faces at. Usually HTML to be thrown on a web server, or questionably PDF files for emailing around.</p>

<p>Swagger UI used to be the only option, and it was a major contributor to me completely ignoring Swagger for years. It not only looks pretty rough, but it hides the data model under a few unclear options, meaning the most important data can hardly be seen.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For REST APIs this can cause a problem; Documenting an API as purely HTTP requests with the actual objects being hidden away as an afterthought leads to them being used like an RPC API, even when they have hypermedia controls available.</p>
