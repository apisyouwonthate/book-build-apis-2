# Build APIs You Won't Hate 2: Oops I Did It Again!

The API World has changed a lot since _["Build APIs You Won't Hate"](https://apisyouwonthate.com/books/build-apis-you-wont-hate/)_ was published in 2014, and keeping the original book up-to-date with [blog posts](https://apisyouwonthate.com/blog) and bonus chapters in the ebook is only holding off the inevitable for so long.

Support the development of this book, and [**pre-order on LeanPub!**](https://leanpub.com/build-apis-you-wont-hate-2/), as we pick up rewriting in mid 2024. We're publishing new chapters as we go, but the price goes up. The earlier you buy the cheaper it will be, but you'll still get all the new chapters as they're released.
