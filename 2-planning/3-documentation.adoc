= Documentation

Throughout the planning phase, all the API developers involved, other folks on your team, and potential clients are going to want to see how this API is going to work. One of many ways to see this is with "API Reference Documentation", which is usually an overview of methods/resources, and looks a lot like the sort of documentation you'd expect to see for a class or function in any programming language. These should always be accompanied by guides and tutorials at a later stage, but early on you will want to provide at least the reference documentation to folks.

Thankfully you have chosen to write down how it all works with contracts, so this will be easy. All we need to do is turn those contract files (probably `.json`, `.yaml`, `.proto`, .etc) into some human-readable documentation for them to point their faces at. Usually HTML to be thrown on a web server, or questionably PDF files for emailing around.

== OpenAPI

OpenAPI has quite a few options for creating reference documentation from source files.

=== Swagger UI

This tool is hard to recommend due to it's very dated appearance.

Swagger UI used to be the only option, and it was a major contributor to me completely ignoring Swagger for years. It not only looks pretty rough, but it hides the data model under a few unclear options, meaning the most important data can hardly be seen.

That said, it has an "API console" built in. More on those later.

=== ReDoc

By far my favourite of the lot, https://github.com/Rebilly/ReDoc[ReDoc] looks absolutely stunning. You can add a logo with the `x-logo` vendor extension, tweak colors, and you get that awesome three-column style popularized by docs like the https://stripe.com/docs/api[Stripe API Documentation].

Beyond the looks, ReDoc focuses a lot of elevating the data model (a.k.a schema) to the documentation viewer. It outlines data types, possible enum values, and all sorts of other handy stuff.

ReDoc can be used as a React command or embedded in HTML, but the most common approach to use it is via the command line. Look at their documentation for instructions, but one way is to install as a node module.

[source]
----
$ npm install -g redoc-cli
----

To see how the documentation looks locally, you can run a local web server using the ReDoc CLI tool.

[source]
----
$ redoc-cli serve openapi.yaml --watch
TODO update example when ubuntu NodeJS stops cocking about
----

This will run a local HTTP server, and you can load up in your local browser. The `--watch` switch means changes to the local files will be automatically detected, and should show up when you refresh the browser.

When somebody else asks for a look, you can then do a few things, but a common thing to do is ask the documentation generator to create HTML for sharing around.

[source]
----
$ redoc-cli bundle openapi.yaml
----

This will create a single HTML file with embedded CSS and JavaScript, which means there are no dependencies other than the one file it creates. You can chuck this up on Amazon S3 or wherever you like to host your static files, then people can take a look and give you feedback.

ReDoc will also have an API console at some point, but it is not complete at time of writing. This will turn a reference documentation tool into a fully fledged, API client, letting your users test out interactions from the browser, and avoiding the need to distribute public Postman collections or similar.

== GraphQL

During the early stages of GraphQL planning and development, you don't really need to create reference documentation in the classic sense. There is an official tool which is essentially an API console with documentation build in.

This tool is https://github.com/graphql/graphiql[GraphiQL], and it is basically an IDE which can run in various environments.

Although you are in the planning stage and might not be sure what language you are going to build this thing in. If you are a big fan of NodeJS and are likely to use ExpressJS, then you are in luck: https://github.com/graphql/express-graphql[express-graphql] has Graphiql built in. There are some other installation instructions on the https://github.com/graphql/graphiql[repository README].

There are also a bunch of Chrome extensions floating around which you can use for this, one of which is called https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chromeiql/fkkiamalmpiidkljmicmjfbieiclmeij[ChromeiQL].

Using these tools you can interact with your fake API, and when you start to develop the real one you can interact with that too.

== gRPC



https://github.com/pseudomuto/protoc-gen-doc
[protoc-gen-doc] is a documentation generator plugin for the Google Protocol Buffers compiler (protoc). The plugin can generate HTML, JSON, DocBook and Markdown documentation from comments in your .proto files.
