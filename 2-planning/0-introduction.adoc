When I was younger and dumber, the planning stage for APIs was pretty much "think of a list of endpoints then start coding" which is wildly insufficient. As the <<theory-contracts,API Contracts>> chapter explained, contracts are incredibly important throughout the life-cycle of an API. We are going to look into how they can be used in the planning and design stage.

Most of the planning and design phase is intended to do two things:

1. Make developers think really hard about the requirements for their API
2. Gather feedback from clients application developers

Poorly planned APIs waste a lot of time and money for a lot of people. I've seen APIs go from v1 to v2 in the first few months after the clients noticed it didn't actually work properly.

You need that feedback early on, with minimal effort from the API developers, and description languages let that happen. The least effort with most reward is to write some OpenAPI/JSON Schema/Protobuf/etc files, turn those into documentation, mock servers, or even sandbox servers, then get feedback on those interfaces.

Feedback is then a simple case of tweaking those files, with no need to change a bunch of code, fix a bunch of tests, etc. Once the interface is agreed upon, the code can then just be written to make that interface work as explained in the contract.

This is much closer to the Agile workflow, instead of the Waterfall model. Waterfall is junk for API development.

So, you are sold that API contracts are the way to go, you've picked your paradigm (and possibly an implementation too), and now you want to start writing down what the actual API is going to look like.

You might not want to start typing YAML or JSON into an empty text file. Nobody does. For that, thankfully, we have editors!
