= Editors

Editors exist in various forms for various API description languages, and they can drastically ease the creation of contracts when starting from scratch. These can take a few forms.

Some editors are GUI-based (Graphical User Interface) and let you design things with clicking buttons and working with forms.

Others are text-based and provide you with a real-time preview panel whilst you type, making it slightly easier than working with plain-old YAML/JSON.

Beyond the "text-based" or "GUI" distinction, there are other characteristics which will effect where the contracts live and how you interact with them.

Some editors are intended for rapid prototyping only, helping you to create an initial design and then push you to export the contracts as text to copy-and-paste, or download as files. From that point on, you're on your own, and have to find some other way to keep your contract files up-to-date.

Others are hosted solutions which keep a hold of your contract files, and offer limited options for syncing to whatever pre-determined locations they chose to support. Maybe something specific like GitLab, or generic git repository, or they publish them to a URL accessible over HTTP, or something else.

Other editors can take the form of desktop applications, which can be used throughout the life-cycle, loading local files and allowing you to edit them at commit them back to the repository (or wherever they live) at will.

== OpenAPI Editors

=== Swagger Editor

Swagger Editor is a very simple hosted text-based editor from https://smartbear.com/[SmartBear].

NOTE: Remember, SmartBear call their suite of tools "Swagger" because they own the copyright and they don't feel like re-branding, but the description language is officially called OpenAPI, not Swagger. Nobody else should be using the word Swagger, or calling their tooling Swagger, or anything else.

Mostly it is just a text-editor, with the left panel being a YAML/JSON editor, and the right panel is https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/[Swagger UI], the documentation tool from SmartBear.

It can be nice to write specifications on the left and see their rendering as documentation on the right, but it would possibly be more useful if the right contained forms for managing the specification beyond modifying text, but the right panel is purely read-only. There are a few forms for adding new operations, tags, servers, etc. but they do not cover everything.

This simple editor helps in a few cases, like:

- You have never written any OpenAPI and want to try playing around with real-time feedback
- You are getting validation errors from some local tool which seem weird, so you bundle the multiple files into one file and paste it up here to see what it says

There is not much else you will want to use Swagger Editor for. If you are splitting files up using `$ref` (which you pretty much always want to do), then this will not work as it only supports the one text box.

For ongoing editing and multi-file support you will need something a bit more powerful.

=== SwaggerHub

https://swagger.io/tools/swaggerhub/[SwaggerHub] is another tool from Smartbear, and it is basically the hosted version of Swagger Editor which has some integrations with the rest of the Swagger tool-suite.

.In this demo of SwaggerHub you can see Swagger Editor in full swing, with a few other options floating around the outside.

SwaggerHub includes a mock server, as most of these editors do. It will help you converting from OpenAPI v2.0 to v3.0 which is a nice touch. The integration with Swagger Inspector - a lovely tool which can help build OpenAPI specifications off of HTTP interactions... more on that later.

The collaboration options here are pretty handy. You can invite users or teams to collaborate on an API, and they have a permissions system which seems pretty closely modelled on Google Docs.

If working with multiple files is possible in SwaggerHub, I have certainly never figured it out. For this reason I have steered clear, but for teams just starting out it might be worth playing with.

The pricing is user-based, and does not seem to support "monthly active users" like slack. Many companies only have 1 or 2 folks who care about API contracts (which is sad and slowly improving over time) but at a company with ~100 engineers (and a better culture), this could get rather expensive. Trying to convince your boss that a YAML text-editor with collaboration might be a tough sell, especially when there are more powerful alternatives, or free open-source offerings.

=== Stoplight

http://stoplight.io/[Stoplight] is a GUI editor, with forms and a much more "Wizard"-like approach. You can ignore the YAML representation entirely and work with their forms and model editors.

Right now they only support OpenAPI v2.0 via the GUI but the text mode supports OpenAPI v3.0. They have all sorts of amazing features. Stoplight has the usual collaboration and mocking, and other features like linting based on style guides, the ability to share models throughout the organization (to avoid having 20 different "user" or "location" representations) and has desktop applications for Windows, Mac and Linux.

I started working for Stoplight right around the time I started writing this second book, so to avoid complex bias I will share some words from Kin "API Evangelist" Lane:

[quote,Kin Lane,API Evangelist]
____
I feel like Stoplight has the potential to shift the landscape pretty significantly, something I haven't seen any API service provider do in a while.
____

More to come on this one. They will most likely have a new suite of tools out before this book goes to the printer.

// TODO Review the fancy new editor

Stoplight costs more than SwaggerHub, but is likely to be an easier sell due to the fact it does a whole lot more. Non-technical users can get in there to play around, and it adds a lot more value beyond being a YAML/JSON text-editor.

=== Free/Open-Source Tools

Bootstrapping a project and have no budget for fancy tooling? Not a problem.

Check out https://openapi.tools[OpenAPI.tools] for an up-to-date list, but there are a few GUI editors, and a few plugins for popular software like https://code.visualstudio.com/[Visual Studio Code], https://atom.io/[Atom], etc. which can ease the struggle of writing the files by hand.

- VS Code: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mermade.openapi-lint[openapi-lint]
- Atom: https://atom.io/packages/linter-swagger[linter-swagger]
- Jetbrains IDE: https://senya.io/[Senya]

Then there is https://apibldr.com/[ApiBldr], a free hosted GUI editor which can help build and then download contracts.

== GraphQL Editors

https://graphqleditor.com/[GraphQL Editor] is a GUI editor, with text on the left where you define various types, and a visual representation of everything as nodes on the right. You can click on those nodes, modify properties, and set criteria like required, null, etc.

It can be installed locally via npm, then invoked as a React component.

If you don't know what any of those things mean then fair enough, there is a hosted version: https://app.graphqleditor.com/[GraphQL Editor Cloud].

As with many editors it comes with an option to provide a mock server for the schemas you've just written up. The hosted version also has the ability to save projects.

== Protobuf Editors

The Protobuf syntax is incredibly simple, and there is not much going on in the way of functionality, so maybe this is why there are not many editors around.

https://sourceforge.net/projects/protobufeditor/[Protobuf Editor] is one I found lurking on SourceForge. It's getting 48 downloads a week at time of writing so might be worth taking for a spin.

== Maybe You Don't Use an Editor

This can be a personal choice. Some folks love having their contracts live up in the cloud so they can be easily collaborated on, some want to keep them in the repository so they can discuss things in GitHub pull-requests for their collaboration, and as such want editors which can work with local files.

Whatever you do, when you start out I recommend using an editor to get the ball rolling. Then later on if you want to tweak things by hand, that's probably ok. It will be a while before you work out your exact workflow for contracts (if nobody has worked that out for you), so it can make sense to just get stuck in with whatever hosted editor, then you can probably export things later and cancel your account if you hate it.

Either way, if you are currently working on an API now, put this book down for a little bit, and get to work on creating some API contracts. It could be nonsense, or it could be a real project, but the next chapter will start by assuming you have written up a bunch of API contracts, and want to put them to work in a mock server to get feedback from potential clients.
