= Server-Side Validation

Validation can mean a lot of things, but in API land it generally means figuring
out if the data being sent to the API is any good or not. Validation can happen
in a lot of different places - it can happen on the server, and it can happen in
the client. Traditionally client-side and server-side validation have both
played a role, covering different use-cases.

Client-side validation is generally used to very quickly provide feedback to a
user, to do things like highlighting the input box that failed, with red
outlines, tooltips explaining that the email address doesn't look valid,
explaining that the "Amount to pay off your credit card" should be higher than
0, etc. These days browsers take care of a lot of the visual feedback so often
client-side validation is not doing quite as much as it used to, but it is still
required for "either field A or B should be set, but not both, and if B is set,
then C should be too." sorts of thing.

Server-side validation has always been required and for an API is the most
important of the two. An API that relies entirely on the client is going to end
up with problems. Data coming from the client can never be trusted because it's
impossible for the server to know what happened on the client. Even if you're
developing a private API for only two known clients, there are always chances
that validation in those clients breaks down; or someone will hit those APIs
with curl or Postman and send some invalid stuff. Even if the database catches
invalid data, the errors won't be as useful as they should be, and will probably 
result in a generic 500 error instead of providing specifics to the client.

Writing validation rules has always been a major source of pains in my neck since 
I started programming, so an approach to syncing the two has forever been on my
mind.

== API Description Documents

Server-side validation is usually doing the most mundane of tasks.

- Is this property required
- Is this property an email address
- Is this property a credit card number
- Is this property required if another property is present

Some frameworks shove this logic in the controller, which is a pain when you
need to validate the same payload in two different use cases. Others shove it in
the data model, like Ruby on Rails:

[source,ruby]
----
class Person < ApplicationRecord
  validates :name, presence: true
  validates :bio, length: { maximum: 1000, too_long: "%{count} characters is the maximum allowed" }
  validates :games_played, numericality: { only_integer: true }
end
----

Doesn't this all sound incredibly familiar? This is exactly what API description
docs are talking about, required, types, formats, etc... all of this is already
handled for us entirely by the same API descriptions we used to generate mock
servers, get generated documentation, that we are using to manage our API
Gateway, etc.

=== JSON Schema Example

For example purposes we are gonna make some JSON Schema validation happen in
Node.js, but you can use any language that has a [JSON Schema
Validator](https://json-schema.org/implementations.html#validators) (which is
most of them).

To use JSON Schema for server-side validation, you normally just grab one of the
validators, shove it in your controller, or "routing" or whatever your language/framework of
choice calls it. Using [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/), we can put this logic in our route.

A fairly familiar `app.js` to Node users, we are just requiring a few bits of code, and
loading the `userSchema`.

[source,javascript]
----
const Ajv = require('ajv');
const express = require('express');
const fs = require('fs');

const ajv = new Ajv();
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

const userFile = './reference/foo-api/models/user.json';
const userSchema = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync());

app.use(express.json());
app.put('/:id', async (req, res) => {
  const updateData = req.body;
  try {
    const valid = ajv.validate(userSchema, updateData);
    if (!valid) {
      res.status(400).json({ errors: ajv.errors });
      return;
    }
  } catch (ex) {
    // ajv.validate may throw, you can handle exceptions here
    res.status(500);
    return;
  }

  // Updates the user with some ORM or whatever

  res.status(200).send('that was great');
});

app.listen(port, () => console.log(`Server on port ${port}!`));
----

That `userSchema` file comes from `user.json` which you can make locally,
and will have contents like this:

[source,javascript]
----
{
  "$id": "http://example.com/schemas/user.json",
  "type": "object",
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "properties": {
    "name": {
      "title": "Name",
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Users full name supporting unicode but no emojis.",
      "maxLength": 20
    },
    "email": {
      "title": "Email",
      "description": "Like a postal address but for computers.",
      "type": "string",
      "format": "email"
    },
    "date_of_birth": {
      "title": "Date Of Birth",
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Date of users birth in the one and only date standard: ISO 8601.",
      "format": "date",
      "example": "1990–12–28"
    }
  },
  "required": [
    "name"
  ]
}
----

When you inspect the structure, you can infer that our JSON object has the
following list of properties: `name`, `email`, and `date_of_birth`. The first
two are strings, and the third is a date. Also, `name` is marked as required.

Now we can run this Node app with `node app.js` and fire HTTP requests at it:

[source]
----
http -v PUT http://localhost:3000/123 name=Frank
----

[source]
----
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Connection: keep-alive
Content-Length: 14
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Date: Sat, 25 May 2019 08:09:10 GMT
ETag: W/"e-4o7E1rWH1O+7xJOCXIMFqIbMSxE"
X-Powered-By: Express

that was great
----

Ok it liked that because `name` was set but `email` and `date_of_birth` are
optional. Let's try sending them, but bad.

[source]
----
http -v PUT http://localhost:3000/123 name=Frank email=notanemail
----

[source]
----
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
Connection: keep-alive
Content-Length: 164
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
X-Powered-By: Express

{
    "errors": [
        {
            "dataPath": ".email",
            "keyword": "format",
            "message": "should match format \"email\"",
            "params": {
                "format": "email"
            },
            "schemaPath": "#/properties/email/format"
        }
    ]
}
----

Oh no! Some errors happened. Sorry!

These errors are not the best format because we just dumped them out for demo
purposes, but this can be tidied up with a simple helper.

If you were already doing validation in the controller, then your controller should be a lot
cleaner, and if you are doing extensive validation in your model then this will remove
a lot of the cruft. If you did not have validation before, then using this approach
means you don't need to start writing it. Win win win!

Also, whilst this works in any language, Ruby folks using Rack (therefore anyone using
Rails too) can use [committee](https://github.com/interagent/committee), a fantastic middleware
for making this a bit easier.

JSON Schema is pretty good at handling request body validation, but having to
put this in every controller can be a bit annoying. OpenAPI can help us out here.

=== OpenAPI Middleware Example

OpenAPI can be a bit easier to implement here, due to it covering the service
model too, not just the data model.

[source,yaml]
----
openapi: "3.0.0"
# ... snip ...
paths:
  /pets:
    post:
      description: Creates a new pet in the store
      operationId: addPet
      requestBody:
        description: Pet to add to the store
        required: true
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              $ref: '#/components/schemas/NewPet'
      responses:
        '200':
          description: pet response
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                $ref: '#/components/schemas/Pet'
----

Seeing as OpenAPI will say "this schema should be used for this combination of HTTP Method and Path" you do not
need to provide the glue. Instead, many languages offer tools that let you just register a middleware, tell that middleware
which OpenAPI file to use, then job done.

Sticking with Node/Express for the examples, let's take a look at using OpenAPI and registering a middleware:

[source,javascript]
----
const express = require('express');
const oasValidator = require('express-ajv-swagger-validation');

const port = 3000;

oasValidator.init('./openapi.yaml').then(function () {
  const app = express();
  app.use(express.json());

  app.get('/pets', oasValidator.validate, function (req, res, next) {
      return res.json({ result: 'OK' });
  });
  app.post('/pets', oasValidator.validate, function (req, res, next) {
      return res.json({ result: 'OK' });
  });
  app.get('/pets/:petId', oasValidator.validate, function (req, res, next) {
      return res.json({ result: 'OK' });
  });

  app.use(function (err, req, res) {
      if (err instanceof oasValidator.InputValidationError) {
          return res.status(400).json({ more_info: JSON.stringify(err.errors) });
      }
  });

  const server = app.listen(serverPort, function () {});
});
----

Tadaaa! You don't have to put the validation checks in all the routes, because
the middleware can handle that for you, and your route/controller code won't
even bother getting invoked if the request coming in is invalid. The framework
middleware is able to look at the request, compare it to the API descriptions,
and reject it with an error format (hopefully something like
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7807[RFC 7807]) before your code even needs to
wake up.

There are a decent number of options out there:

For OpenAPI v3.0:

- **PHP:** https://github.com/thephpleague/openapi-psr7-validator[thephpleague/openapi-psr7-validator]
- **Node.js:** [fastify](https://github.com/fastify/fastify/blob/master/docs/Validation-and-Serialization.md) / [express-swagger-ajv-validator](https://github.com/Zooz/express-ajv-swagger-validation)
- **Ruby/Rails:** [committee](https://github.com/interagent/committee)
- **Python:** [connexion](https://github.com/zalando/connexion)
- **Perl:** [Mojolicious::Plugin::OpenAPI](https://metacpan.org/pod/Mojolicious::Plugin::OpenAPI)

For OpenAPI v2.0:

- **Rails:** [swagger_shield](https://github.com/amcaplan/swagger_shield)

The Rails tool swagger_shield is great. It wins maximum "Wont Hate Points" for using RFC 7807 on failure:

[source,javascript]
----
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "status": "422",
      "detail": "The property '#/widget/price' of type string did not match the following type: integer",
      "source": {
        "pointer": "#/widget/price"
      }
    }
  ]
}
----

== Some Validation Still Required

This is only going to handle validation rules which do not require looking in a
data store, or need some other sort of programming to run. You can do rather a lot
with JSON Schema or OpenAPI, but it cannot tell you if the email address is valid,
or if this resource is generally in the right state to be doing the thing you are
trying to do.

Not a problem. You can still perform your own checks after this validation is done,
and because everything is all https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7807[using RFC 7807] the whole way through then your code
and the middleware and everything else will all match. Lovely!

== Testing Benefits

There are two huge benefits we have not quite got to yet, beyond the time and money saved from
not having to write out a bunch of validation code.

_**The whole idea of trying to [ keep docs in sync with
code](/blog/keeping-documentation-honest) goes out the window when your
description documents are literally code.**_

Seeing as you are using the same description documents to handle request
validation that you are using for your documentation, mock server, etc, there is
no need for extra logic to ensure your requests are correctly described (or
documented). You can just do your usual integration testing on requests,
and you are all set.

[source,ruby]
----
it 'should conform to user schema' do
  get "/users/#{subject.id}"
  expect(response).to match_json_schema('user')
end
----

Your test suite handling bog standard unit and integration tests are now proving
your documented requests are correct, and if somebody changes how requests work
without updating the description docs, they've been caught in the act and their
pull requests will fail. If they update the description in the pull request to
fix the tests, boom, we can now have a little chat about why they just tried to
commit a breaking change...! 🧐

== Future of Server-Side Validation

This is a very old concept which has recently picked up steam as more developers
catch onto the API Design-first workflow.

One of the benefits of writing HTTP APIs is that you usually are not locked into
a single implementation, and do not have to try and force the "one size fits all"
tooling that comes with it. Sadly that means some of the tools for some of the
languages aren't as excellent as others, but as we are a community of open-source
developers we can fix that.

I've heard developers say "this is not performant" but there is no reason to
believe that. A specific tool might not be written the most efficient way, but
that can be fixed with PRs. So long as the tool is not parsing the entire document
on the fly, and on startup constructs some sort of artifacts in memory, this could
easily be more performant than running whatever behemoth of a "validation library"
you've loaded up to do all this manually.

Another approach is to skip out on doing it in the server-side, and move it up a
level: to the API Gateway. We'll be writing more about that soon, but most API
gateways are starting to get smarter about how they accept API descriptions as input,
and how they use that input.

AWS Gateway support a subset of OpenAPI, Tyk support JSON Schema, and https://www.express-gateway.io/[Express Gateway] support https://www.express-gateway.io/docs/policies/customization/conditions/#json-schema[JSON Schema].
