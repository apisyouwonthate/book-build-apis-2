= Asynchronous Paradigms

So far the discussion of these paradigms has probably seemed rather similar,
they are all following a request and response structure. Getting a response from
a request is one way to do things, but there are lots of situations where a
client might expect more than one response, or a response with more information
later as more work happens on the server side.

== Client-Server "Real-Time" Models

Let's have a quick run through some of the common models for doing
asynchronous stuff. Even though you might not want to use some of these, it is
good to know what they are, even if that is only so you can recommend not doing
it when somebody else brings them up in a planning meeting.

=== Short Polling

The first approach that often gets mentioned is short polling, which is the
client-server equivalent of a child in the backseat of the car asking "are we
there yet? are we there yet? are we there yet?". The client is making the same
GET request to the same resource every few seconds, waiting for some sort of
change in the answer.

----
00:00:00 C-> Is the cake ready?
00:00:01 S-> No, wait.
00:00:01 C-> Is the cake ready?
00:00:02 S-> No, wait.
00:00:02 C-> Is the cake ready?
00:00:03 S-> Yeah. Have some.
00:00:03 C-> Is the other cake ready? ...
----

The only benefit of short polling is that it is _very_ easy to implement. The
client can just write a while loop that makes a request, checks for a response,
then sleeps for a few seconds before making another request.

The main downside with short polling is that it's a very chatty approach, which
makes it awful to scale. The more clients you have making these requests the
more load your API has to handle, and it can grow exponentially. Conditional
network caching can help a bit here, but even then it sucks the battery life on
mobile devices.

Generally short polling is rubbish, and you should try to avoid it.

=== Long Polling

A slight tweak on the concept of short polling, long polling maintains an open
connection with the server until the answer comes in.

----
00:00:00 C-> Is the cake ready?
* some time later *
00:00:03 S-> Yeah. Have some.
00:00:03 C-> Is the other cake ready?
----

See here that instead of answering immediately, the server waited 3 seconds
before responding with a single update.

Generally folks recommend long polling when the client is only waiting for one
answer, so if they are ordering a single cake and it might be ready soon, then
great, let that thread focus on replying about the one cake, and when that cake
is done the connection is closed. If the client wants multiple status updates,
or is interested in multiple cakes, this might not be the way to go.

Personal experiences tell me this sort of blocking activity can lead to quite a
mess when you have more than a smattering of users. Blocking an entire web
thread for 3 seconds can certainly be a problem when you have a lot of clients
asking about a lot of cakes.

For example, in Rails land this is a pretty common server config:

[source,ruby]
----
workers Integer(ENV['WEB_CONCURRENCY'] || 2)
threads_count = Integer(ENV['RAILS_MAX_THREADS'] || 5)
threads threads_count, threads_count

rackup      DefaultRackup
port        ENV['PORT']     || 3000
environment ENV['RACK_ENV'] || 'development'
----

If there was only one web server running then 2 * 5 = 10 and thats only 10 cake
orders happening at the same time and you've run out of threads for other
things, like accepting payments, or registering a user.

Even having a slightly bulkier setup, with more dynos, and more processes, and more threads,
it's simply a numbers game where you are just throwing more money / resources at the situation. There are better ways to scale long-term.

=== Web Hooks

Both these polling approaches are essentially a pull model, so lets look at a
push model: Web Hooks. Clients register a "callback URL" through a
GUI or API, and they may also specify specific types of information they are
interested in receiving. When relevant events happen on the server, it will fire
a payload at that URL, which usually takes the form of a HTTP
POST request.

.Examples of Web Hooks in popular APIs.
- https://developer.github.com/webhooks/[GitHub API > Webhooks]
- https://api.slack.com/incoming-webhooks[Slack API > Incoming Webhooks]
- https://stripe.com/docs/webhooks[Stripe API > Webhooks]

A few years ago my friend and I made a website that sold silly programmer joke
t-shirts. We created the whole thing over beers, and we made some whopping
mistakes. Everything was written in a synchronous fashion as we didn't care
about speed at that early stage. The biggest mistake was that when the payment
API gave us a positive response to the `POST` request, we immediately considered
the payment good and marked the shirts for dispatch.

It turns out there was a web hook we were meant to listen out for, and this
would confirm if the payment had been accepted, or not... Seeing as we totally
ignored that, there were a few t-shirts that went out for free! Oops.

This was simple enough to fix, we added a `/callback` endpoint, registered it
with the payment gateway, and they would fire updates at it once the payment was
confirmed. We simply marked orders as pending in the meantime and only marked
them for dispatch (and sent emails to the customers) once we received the
confirmation via web hooks.

Web hooks are often thought of as a bit of a dark art, because they happen
outside of the normal request/response stuff that API developers are used to. It
can be hard to see them happen, tricky to confirm they are sending what you
think, and they used to be tricky to document.

These days there are loads of awesome tools around to help. OpenAPI v3.0 added support for
https://swagger.io/docs/specification/callbacks/[Callbacks], which is another common name
for web hooks (seeing as the payload is fired at a "Callback URL").

Tools to help with this stuff:

- https://pipedream.com/[PipeDream] - Formerly known as RequestBin, create an endpoint and register that as the callback URL, and see what traffic is coming in. Then maybe copy that to use in a test suite
- https://ngrok.com/[ngrok] - Create a tunnel to your locally running application and register your local app as the callback URL


That ngrok mention might have made you notice an issue with web hooks: some sort
of DNS or known IP address of the specific machine to fire the payload at. If
the client is written in PHP, Java, Node, Ruby, etc. and running behind a web
server then yeah, it will probably have one of those, but if the client is a
JavaScript application running in the users browser then that isn't going to
work.

For that we need another approach, and that is... ü•Å

=== WebSocket

WebSocket is a whole other protocol to HTTP, that operates over TCP directly.
Instead of a client asking the server over and over again, or making a blocking
connection to the web server, the client establishes a connection to the server,
and then the two parties can send messages back and forth in real-time, and the
server doesn't need to know the IP address of the client because the client
initiated the connection. Cool!

[quote,Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket]
----
Both protocols are located at layer 7 in the OSI model and depend on TCP at layer 4. Although
they are different, RFC 6455 states that WebSocket "is designed to work over
HTTP ports 80 and 443 as well as to support HTTP proxies and intermediaries"
thus making it compatible with the HTTP protocol. To achieve compatibility, the
WebSocket handshake uses the HTTP Upgrade header to change from the HTTP
protocol to the WebSocket protocol.
----

Basically whatever client and server side code you are using, it will do the same
thing: the server provides a WebSocket URL to the client, and they connect, and
messages can then go either way. Just like HTTP has `http://` and `https://`,
there is `ws://` and `wss://`.

// TODO: Above you say that we will not open a connection for too long to save valuable time on the webserver, instead we introduce callbacks/webhooks to solve that. Now we get to WebSockets, which does exactly what we wanted to avoid, opening a connection for quite some (probably very long) time :)


[source,javascript]
____
// Create WebSocket connection
const socket = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8080/cakes/abc123');

// Connection opened
socket.addEventListener('open', function (event) {
    socket.send('Hello Server!');
});

// Listen for messages
socket.addEventListener('message', function (event) {
    console.log('update RE that cake ', event.data);
});
____

The fact that HTTP and WS are quite similar in many ways, and that they are
compatible in general, makes it really easy to add WebSocket's into your HTTP API
by using a web server that has it built in. MDN maintain
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API#Tools[a list of
WebSocket tools] for folks interested in giving it a try, including web servers
that support them.

You can punt figuring out how to run a WebSocket server entirely, by using
hosted solutions like https://pusher.com/[Pusher] and
https://www.pubnub.com/websockets/[PubNub].

=== Message Brokers & Job Queues

One important idea here is the server being able to "do stuff later",
without having the client twiddle their thumbs waiting for updates. How exactly do
we do that? Generally the idea is to push an event into a job queue, and then
some sort of worker process will pick up that message and "work on the job".

Sometimes this is done with tools based on AMQP or MQTT, two protocols designed
for "Message Brokering" in general. That is a whole topic by itself, and job
queues are just one of many possible use cases that message brokers can cover.
These tools run their own server which acts as a "broker", and they send the
messages off to "subscribers" who can get things done.

A more simplistic approach for job queues is to use tooling like Sidekiq (a
popular Ruby tool for handling job queues), or the more recent polyglot version
Faktory. These sorts of solutions are popular because they just run off of Redis
as the queue, and often run in the same codebase just on different threads.

For example, in rails you often have `app/workers` sat next to `app/controllers`
and all your other regular code, so you can use the same database connection
logic, hit the same libraries and dependencies, etc. This makes the setup a bit
less confusing for many.

Whatever message broker / job worker / do it later approach you use, you need to
let  the client know that work is being done in the background. For an HTTP API
this is usually done with a `202 Accepted` response code, which also lets the
client know they should look out for some sort of link in the body or headers to
get their updates, in whatever way you normally offer hypermedia controls.

== Real World Examples

Alrighty, that was a lot of text, even for the Theory part of the book, so let's
get some visuals in here.

Let's start accepting payments with a HTTP API, where a user is buying
something from your website. Once they make a payment, they want to know if
it has been accepted or not, so they know if they are getting their hilarious
t-shirt.

.A completely synchronous approach to handling a payment from a GUI, with your API accepting the information and sending it off to an external API acting as a payment gateway.

If the world was a perfect place, this would be fine. All messages would somehow
move faster than the speed of light, all servers would always be responding
perfectly, and no messages would be lost in transit, meaning the user gets a
nice, quick, consistent experience and the user interface does not leave them
guessing.

Sadly none of this is true, but people seem to design their data flows like it
might be. The above flow will leave the user sat there twiddling their thumbs
for however long it takes that API gateway to respond.

There is one issue here that the user is twiddling their thumbs for 30 seconds,
but a bigger issue is that the API server is twiddling its thumbs for 30
seconds (rather than serving other requests). You realize that the payment gateway is too slow to use synchronous
requests to talk to them, so you decide to shift that to a worker.

Alright, better. Our client is a bit chatty and is generating a lot of overheard, but hey they are getting relatively real time updates. Maybe this is good enough, but maybe we want to improve this even more with a WebSocket.

Now the client is getting real time updates, and not just "is it done or not" but actual progress on various things happening. Also the background worker is able to talk directly to the client, instead of just updating the state in the API and hoping the client checks for a change.

Again this might be just fine, but the last remaining bottleneck is the interaction with this slow third party API. Even though the slowness is in the background worker, maybe the worker is backing up a bunch, due to high demand. During Black Friday this might mean your workers are so backed up they're taking 20 minutes to get to updating, because most of them are spending all the CPU cycles just waiting.

Maybe the company providing this payment gateway realized that 30-60 sync requests are daft, and implemented Web Hooks on their end. Let's update our approach to support that.

Some notable differences here, mostly that the worker is just responsible for passing on the job to the payment gateway. Seeing as the API has registered a callback URL, the payment gateway can fire a HTTP POST payload right at our API, and the API can push the message into the WebSocket to update the client.

Why would you still want to use a worker if the third-party payment gateway is doing things asynchronously itself? Well, if that third party gateway goes down, or is acting slowly, your API will also fail, or perform slowly. Chucking a background worker in there adds a bit of resilience to your system, especially as most background workers have automatic retry logic for failed jobs.

// TODO My friends at a ticket selling website would ping the Slack API when a sale was made to post a message, but slack went down, and nobody could buy tickets as the API interaction was sync. they tried to deploy a fix but their deployment system was tied to slack... BAHAHAHA

== Asynchronous REST APIs

Some people think that polling is inherently part of how some APIs (like
REST) are meant to work, but that is not really the case. The REST dissertation does talk
about REST being a pull model, and it is, but it can absolutely be supplanted with push too.

[quote,Roy Fielding,https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm]
----
The interaction method of sending representations of resources to consuming components has some parallels with event-based integration (EBI) styles. The key difference is that EBI styles are push-based. The component containing the state (equivalent to an origin server in REST) issues an event whenever the state changes, whether or not any component is actually interested in or listening for such an event. In the REST style, consuming components usually pull representations. Although this is less efficient when viewed as a single client wishing to monitor a single resource, the scale of the Web makes an unregulated push model infeasible.
----

You can use any of these methods in your REST API, or any other HTTP API. As mentioned before, using HATEOAS you can return links in your API data (or headers), and those links can be to whatever protocol you like. Give the client a link to a `wss://` and they'll know to connect to a WebSocket, or provide a HTTP link and they can poll it. Or both! Choice is fun.

== Asynchronous GraphQL APIs

GraphQL has a special `subscription` keyword equal to `query` and `mutation`.
There is no information on how these work on the GraphQL.org website at time of
writing, but third-party vendors explain the situation fairly well.

Basically GraphQL subscriptions add real-time functionality to GraphQL
_somehow_, and that somehow is usually implemented via WebSockets. Apollo have
some docs on how they suggest
https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphql-subscriptions[implementing GraphQL
subscriptions in their documentation], but if you are using something other than
Apollo you will have to work that one out for yourself.
