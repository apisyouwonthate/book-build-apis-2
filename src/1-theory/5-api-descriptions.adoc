= API Descriptions

The "I" in "API" means interface, and so writing a description for that interface
is the act of writing down what that interface is going to look like, to avoid
folks having to guess, or go and hunt for some documentation somewhere.

Let's use the fantastic https://pokeapi.co/[PokeAPI] as an example.

[source,javascript]
----
{
  "id": 12,
  "name": "butterfree",
  "base_experience": 178,
  "height": 11,
  "is_default": true,
  "order": 16,
  "weight": 320,
  "abilities": [{
    "is_hidden": true,
    "slot": 3
  }]
}
----

If we look just at the data, we can deduce that sure, ID is probably an
auto-incrementing identifier, the name seems to be a lower-cased English string,
but after that it starts getting a bit odd.

Height and weight, I guess there is no imperial and metric in the game just
units, but what is order all about? The order that pokemon is sat in my current
party? That Ash bumped into in the cartoon? In order of cuteness? What?!

An API description can help answer most of the questions and more for anyone
wanting to understand how an API is meant to work.

- Which resources or methods are available and how do you interact with them?
- Which HTTP headers are required for that endpoint, for things like authentication?
- Which properties are available in the request and response?
- What are those various properties data types?
- Which of those properties are required or optional?
- What other validation rules can be applied to those properties?

NOTE
====
Some people use the term "API Specifications" to describe all this, but
the word "specification" is used to mean a lot of different things. HTTP has a
specification, most programming languages have a specification, many people 
even use "message formats" or "hypermedia formats" like JSON:API, HAL, or Protobuf,
all of which also have their own specification.

If we keep in mind that there are lot of types of specifications involved with APIs,
it can be less confusing if we categorize the type of specification we are talking 
about, and refer to "API Descriptions".
====

Sometimes they are also referred to as "contracts", usually in the context of
"contract testing" (this is covered in later chapters), and a contract is a good
way to think about what an API description is. 

[quote, The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]
____
A contract is an agreement between two or more parties, especially one that is written and enforceable by law.
____

Thinking about writing a contract for how the API will work might sound a bit
odd if you just think about an API as sharing some data or as a convenient way
to trigger commands on another server, but people need to know what that data
is, or what arguments they should send to those commands.

The enforceable bit is important too. We can use those descriptions in our test
suite to confirm that our actual APIs are following the rules of the contract.

Written down exactly from an early point (and agreed upon) means that there are
far fewer surprises throughout the API life-cycle, from planning, through
development, and into usage by clients.

Having a good description means that API developers can be confident that:

1. The interface is doing what they intend
2. The interface is going to be useful for client developers
3. The interface is understood well by client developers
4. The interface is not changing accidentally when code changes

This confidence will save everyone a lot of time, money and frustration. Having
no descriptions in place leads to slower rollout of the initial version, loads more
time spent testing subsequent deployments, and wasted developer time having
loads of meetings to explain things that could have been written down and clear
to everyone already.

== What forms can an API Description take?

Some folks might think "That sounds like documentation", others might think
"That sounds like tests". The answer is both, and more.

API descriptions can exist in several forms, some more useful than others.

=== The Dreaded Verbal Contract

A common case is the verbal contract, where the API developers discuss it with
the frontend or other client application developers as they go. The backend
developers write their code, the client developers write theirs, and as various
endpoints or properties are conceived, they are explained somehow: literally
explained out loud over the conference room table, shouted over a hail of nerf
gun pellets and ping pong, or DMed over Slack chats.

----
Fred: Hey Sarah, there’s a new "fudge" field and it can be "blah" or "whatever".

Sarah: Great! Thanks I’ll chuck that in now.
----

This might seem good enough as the API works, the app runs fine, the
project/product managers are happy, and the company may even be making money off
of this whole thing. Sadly this method has a bunch of downsides.

The primary issue is that communication is hard. You never really know if
somebody understood what you meant even if they say they did.

Beyond that, not having things written down means people can forget. If another
client team also needs the information and they ask another client team, they
are getting a copy of a copy which might be slightly wrong.

Another outcome is the original author(s) cannot remember the exact rules,
leading to time wasted checking the code. An even worse scenario is that the
original author(s) are not reachable for some reason. Maybe the whole team of
developers who worked on that API are all on a flight together from New York to
Uruguay, and for that entire 9 hour flight nobody can get any answers about how
the API is supposed to work, so they're stuck not being able to fix a production
issue... They might also have quit.

When folks rely on a verbal contract, two common things happen:

1. Developers waste time writing a new endpoint out of fear of using the old one
2. Developers waste time trying to guess the interface, and might guess wrong

=== Shoddy Manual Descriptions

When folks first start thinking about descriptions, it often takes the form of
rudimentary API Reference Documentation. This might be dumped into a Google Doc,
shoved in a wiki, or written up in finger blistering HTML. These formats are
usually fairly painstaking to create, because you are focusing on formatting
_and_ content, shuffling things around whenever you remember that you should
list headers too, and copying and pasting examples of JSON which might change
over time. API developers would not settle for writing software like this, but
apparently when it comes to documentation it's accepted as the norm.

This whole slow, manual approach is probably why many people forgo writing
descriptions this way, and opt for verbal contracts instead. It probably would not
be a huge jump to say the "startup mindset" (and "agile") are one of a few
potential driving factors in this "just get on with it" approach. There are many
technical leaders inexperienced in this area telling their team "We'll write
lovely docs later when we've got more time!", without realizing their lack of
clarity is slowing down initial development, client integrations, increasing
testing efforts, and causing bizarre production issues and throughout their
ecosystem.

Anyway, aside from this medium of API descriptions being time consuming, it is also
impossible to enforce. After you have spent the time writing up a Google
Doc/HTML/Wiki, the only output of that is going to be... a Google Doc/HTML/Wiki
and maybe a PDF if you want to go wild. You can't exactly jam that Google Doc
into an API test suite and have it confirm that the API is conforming to
whatever is written in there.

There is another way.

=== Description Formats

A description format can be text based or look a bit like a programming
language. This format lets you describe an API in a reusable way, which means
you can do a whole bunch of stuff:

- Documentation
- Client-side validation
- Server-side validation
- Client-library Generation (SDKs)
- UI Generation
- Server/Application generation
- Mock servers
- Contract testing
- Automated Postman/Paw Collections

An early example of that would be SOAP, which used something called a WSDL,
something discussed in the previous chapter.

[quote, Wikipedia]
____
The Web Services Description Language is an XML-based interface definition
language that is used for describing the functionality offered by a web service.
The acronym is also used for any specific WSDL description of a web service,
which provides a machine-readable description of how the service can be called,
what parameters it expects, and what data structures it returns. Therefore, its
purpose is roughly similar to that of a type signature in a programming
language.
____

WSDLs were only used for SOAP, and not many paradigms or implementations seemed
to bother with this sort of description format for a long time. Luckily that
has all changed over the last few years.

Before we look at how various description formats are used today, lets learn
another bit of theory.

== Service Model & Data Model

Two terms that pop up from time to time are "service model" and "data model".
These are two ways to specify which part of the API contract you are talking
about.

image::images/data-model-service-model.png[]

The service model is the language used to describe things like the URL, HTTP
method, headers like content type, authentication strategy, etc. It is used to
explain all the things outside of the message, the stuff peripheral to the
actual data. In a programming language this would be class names, method names,
possible exceptions, but would not cover anything about the arguments: type
hints, possible validations, etc.

The data model is used to describe the contents of the message, which is
probably what you find in the HTTP body. The word "schema" is often associated
with the data model too. They are often just two different terms describing the
same concept, but often the term "schema" is used to represent the actual
technical file containing the description format, and the term data model is
more theoretical.

With this in mind, lets go look at how descriptions are written for endpoint-based
APIs (REST, RESTish, some RPC), GraphQL and gRPC.

== Introduction to API Description Formats

Any generic HTTP API can use the same description formats, but the modern
implementations which the conventions of HTTP to roll their own approach require
their own specific description formats.

Here we use the term "HTTP APIs" to group REST, RESTish, and regular RPC when
it's just interacting over HTTP (GET, POST, etc) without some other set of
conventions like gRPC getting involved.

=== HTTP APIs: OpenAPI & JSON Schema

In the HTTP API world there were a few such as https://apiblueprint.org/[API
Blueprint], https://raml.org/[RAML], and OpenAPI (at the time called Swagger),
but for years the tooling was a bit lacking, and mostly only allowed for
outputting as documentation.

OpenAPI v3.0 popped in 2015 up which solved a lot of problems with OpenAPI v2.0,
and beat the heck out of the other description formats. It took a few years for
tooling to catch up, but by 2018 pretty much everything supported OpenAPI v3.0,
and this description format settled as the mainstream favourite.

----
The OpenAPI Specification (OAS) defines a standard, programming
language-agnostic interface description for REST APIs, which allows both humans
and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of a service without
requiring access to source code, additional documentation, or inspection of
network traffic.

----

OpenAPI is a YAML or JSON based descriptive language which covers endpoints,
headers, requests and responses, allows for examples in different mime types,
outlines errors, and even lets developers write in potential values, validation
rules, etc.

Another popular language is http://json-schema.org/[JSON Schema], which parts of OpenAPI
are based on. The two are mostly compatible, and are both used for slightly different but complimentary things.

OpenAPI can describe both service and data model, and JSON Schema mainly only
defines the data model. In the example above, everything under `paths` is
describing the service model, then everything under `components.schemas` is
describing the data model. The schema keywords that OpenAPI v3.0 uses are based
on JSON Schema, and there is a bit of a tangent we should look into here about
compatibility.

[[WARNING]]
====
OpenAPI v3.0 schema objects are a subset/superset/sideset implementation of
_JSON Schema draft 05_. Most JSON Schema keywords are available and work as
expected, a few extra OpenAPI-only keywords were added, but some JSON Schema
keywords are not supported. There is also the tricky situation where JSON Schema
has continued to progress quickly since draft 5 (draft 8 is almost complete at
time of writing).

This can cause confusion for new developers, but interoperability
amongst standards is always a tricky one. Thankfully, future versions of OpenAPI
(probably v3.1) aim to solve this, so no need to get too stuck in the weeds here.

====

OpenAPI contract files are usually static. They're usually written down along
with the source code, then sometimes deployed to a file hosting service like S3
for folks to use. Some managers want to treat these like business secrets and
hide them under lock and key, which makes absolutely no damned sense as they are
meta-data only. Most "hackers" could probably figure out that you keep your list
of companies under `GET /companies`, so just don't make that a publicly
available endpoint and you're gonna be ok. PayPal, Microsoft, and other
companies make their OpenAPI descriptions available to anyone who wants to download
them, and this approach can help folks integrate with your APIs.

You can imagine an OpenAPI file growing to be rather unwieldy once its got 50+
endpoints and more complex examples, but have no fear you can spread things
around in multiple files to make it a lot more DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and
useful. The first thing to go is usually the `components.schemas` definitions,
which can be moved to their own files. Once these are split into their own
files, an extra step can be taken to turn them into proper JSON Schema files.
Once they are split out they can be referenced in a HTTP response header.

When a client sees this they can use it for all sorts of things - like form
generation and client-side validation - all without needing to figure out how to
distribute the files to them ahead of time.

[[NOTE]]
====
One more note on OpenAPI and its old name Swagger. You still see the word Swagger floating around a lot. SmartBear, the original authors of the "Swagger" API description format, still use the word Swagger in a lot of their tooling because they have the brand recognition. The description format itself was renamed to OpenAPI and handed over to the OpenAPI Initiative.

Since 2015, anyone calling it Swagger is out of date, and the fact that folks keep using the word Swagger in 2019 is still a huge source of confusion. If you look for "Swagger tools" you will only find those from SmartBear, or really really out of date ones. Call it OpenAPI, search for OpenAPI, and we don't need to keep saying OpenAPI/Swagger like they are two alternative but equally valid things.
====

OpenAPI and JSON Schema are a fantastic pair, and we will show how to combine the two throughout the book.

==== GraphQL Schemas

GraphQL as an implementation comes bundled with
https://graphql.org/learn/schema/[GraphQL Schemas]. GraphQL does not really have
a service model, as it does not need one.

Seeing as most interactions operate under a
single HTTP endpoint like `POST /graphql`, there is no real need to
bother writing a contract around that in great detail. It would just be
mentioned in passing as an implementation detail, and the majority of the effort
would go into describing the data model.

NOTE: Some folks might have different endpoints for different use-cases, but
this is rarely spotted in the wild.

All the GraphQL documentation examples are Star Wars. Sure, it's obviously
inferior to Stargate SG-1, but let's reuse their examples for simplicity:

.An example of GraphQL schemas in the GraphQL Schema Language, implementing interfaces and sharing properties across different types.
[source,graphql]
----
interface Character {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  friends: [Character]
  appearsIn: [Episode]!
}

type Human implements Character {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  friends: [Character]
  appearsIn: [Episode]!
  starships: [Starship]
  totalCredits: Int
}

type Droid implements Character {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  friends: [Character]
  appearsIn: [Episode]!
  primaryFunction: String
}
----

The syntax in this example is using the
https://facebook.github.io/graphql/draft/#sec-Type-System[GraphQL Schema
Language] (a.k.a IDL), but these files can be written in whatever programming
language the API is built in: JavaScript, PHP, Go, whatever.

Writing them in Go for example would make them a little tricky to interact with
for other languages, like trying to give these types to a JavaScript web-app. If
the client really needs them, a lot of the language-specific implementations
offer a way to "Dump" them to the IDL, which can then be read by the client with
the right tooling.

If dumping and distributing isn't a viable workflow,
https://graphql.org/learn/introspection/[introspection] can be used! This is
basically the process of quering the GraphQL API for information about the
schema, just like how `Link` is used to provide the client with the JSON Schema
in other HTTP APIs.

GraphQL schema does not support validation rules defined in the contract -
beyond required/optional/null like OpenAPI and JSON Schema, but there are some
extensions floating around which can help. More on all of that later.

==== gRPC: Protobuf

gRPC uses another Google tool for its API contract:
https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/[Protobuf]. Protobuf is basically
a serializer for data going over the wire. Much like GraphQL and its schemas,
Protobuf is integral to gRPC. Instead of schemas they call them "Message Types",
but it's all the same sort of idea.

Instead of writing them in whatever language the API is written in (like
GraphQL), a new  `.proto` file is written using
https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto[Protocol Buffer
Language Syntax]. This C-family/Java style language exists solely for writing
these files. It might be a bit of a pain to figure out a brand new syntax, but
it has the benefit of being fairly portable as you can read them in multiple
languages. Finding a JavaScript, Ruby, Python, Go, etc. tool that can read a
`.proto` file is a whole lot easier than trying to get Python to read something
written in  - for example - JavaScript.

Rarely are `.proto` files made available over a URL, they are usually bundled
and distributed with client code. Then usually things are kept backwards
compatible until the clients have upgraded whatever client code brought the
`.proto` files their way.

== When Are Descriptions Written, And By Who?

At what stage these descriptions are written, and by who, is very much up to the
culture of the organization. In some organizations the culture is "We dont
bother at all" and I've been there. I spent two years helping teams fix the
issues that came up from being vague about this stuff, and witnessed a lot of my
friends and colleagues waste time (and the companies time) guessing interfaces.

When I first got to that company, the culture relating to API descriptions was:

====
That's the thing that Phil keeps going on about, I think? Just ignore him. We've got unstable, untested, undocumented APIs full of problems to try and sort out, and they're being misused by clients. No time for any of that contract-first planning, or contract-later nonsense.
====

Two years later and that culture had changed substantially, to the point where
most older APIs had descriptions written down, and new ones invariably had
descriptions written before the work was started. Don't make me come to your office
and shout at you for two years, just start designing your APIs properly now.

Who should create and maintain descriptions? Everyone.

When they should be created? As early as possible.

If one person is tasked with developing an API, then that is the one person who
should be writing the descriptions as part of the design phase, all of which 
should happen long before they start writing any code.

If a whole team is tasked with developing an API, then that team should split up
the design work between them.

The planning process involved getting out a whiteboard, getting a few of your
clients in a room so you can listen to their needs (instead of just dictating
to them), get somebody who knows a bit more about systems architecture than the
average developer does (everyone thinks they're an expert), and hash out some
ideas.

When those ideas start to solidify, start writing things down, and turn those
notes into API descriptions. When they're ready, get them into a GitHub pull
request, or some other collaborative place, and folks on your team can start to
review them.

Sometimes you would even see full service and data models written up and
attached to the Jira tasks!footnote:[Jira is a 'popular' piece of project management software from Atlassian].

=== Design-First vs Design-Later

Whenever the topic of API design-first comes up, somebody will say "Damn, that
sounds pretty good, but we already have an API written, and we didn't write down
the contract!"

// TODO I dont want to have a fight about why annotations are utterly useless most of the time, how they require you to write your code before you can plan or mock it, or why "putting annotations near code mean devs will keep it up to date" is a horse shit argument that means nothing.

Fear not. Some more strict languages like Go and Java have annotation-based
systems which can allow you to sprinkle some syntax around your applications to
generate some API descriptions. This approach does not work so well for dynamic
programming languages like Ruby because anything can be anything and you end up
having to write so much into comments and annotations, that you might as well
just be writing proper API descriptions.

There are a few tools out there which will help you create descriptions by
reading your HTTP traffic and inferring description from what it sees..

== Summary

The terms "schema", and "data model", are usually closely related. In the terms
of an HTTP API, the data model describes the body of the HTTP message, and the
technical document or actual file which provides that description is often
referred to as a schema.

Ask a bunch of different people and you will get a lot of difference answers,
but these terms will be used throughout the book just so there is one standard
way of talking.

Writing down descriptions might seem like a lot of work, but these days it should
no longer be considered as an optional step. Flinging around arbitrary JSON and
hoping people and other applications are all using it properly over time is just
reckless, selfish, and actually makes work considerably more mundane. Seeing as
API descriptions are not just for creating documentation, writing the description down
with a decent description format increases productivity throughout the
life-cycle of the API. Then reference documentation appears for free as one of
many outputs of the description format using documentation generators.

Later chapters will cover exactly how descriptions can get involved at various
points, like how we can use the descriptions to get feedback, and specific tools we
can use to collaborate on this stuff.

This introduction will most likely have left you with questions, and they will
be answered throughout the rest of the book.
