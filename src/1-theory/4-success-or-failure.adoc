= Success or Failure

Dealing with the Happy Path‚Ñ¢ in an API is pretty easy: When a client asks for a
resource, show them the resource. When they trigger a procedure, let them know
if it was triggered ok, and maybe if it completed without a problem.

What to do when something doesn't go according to plan? Well, that can be
tricky.

== Errors

HTTP status codes are part of the picture, they can define a category of issue,
but they are never going to explain the whole story.

Two examples from a carpooling application which had a "simulated savings" endpoint, to let folks know how much they might save picking up a passenger on their daily commute:

.This error let the client know the coordinates were too close together, meaning it is not even worth driving let alone trying to pick anyone else up.
[source,text]
----
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request

{
  "errors" : [{
    "code"   : 20002,
    "title"  : "There are no savings for this user."
  }]
}
----

.This carpool driver is trying to create a trip from Colombia to Paris.
[source,text]
----
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request

{
  "errors" : [{
    "code"   : 20010,
    "title"  : "Invalid geopoints for possible trip."
  }]
}
----

This is often touted as a failing of the HTTP status code concept, but it was
never intended to cover every single possible application specific error
message. Think of HTTP status codes like an exception. In Ruby you might get a
`ArgumentError` or `LoadError` exception which gives you a pretty good hint as
to what the issue is, but there is also data specific to the instance of that
failure that helps with fixing the situation.

.Programming languages do not just give you the exception name, they give you instance information too.
[source,ruby]
----
> require "nonsense"
LoadError (cannot load such file -- nonsense)
----

Errors in HTTP APIs are pretty similar to exceptions: they can tell the client
what is going on, and combine a bunch of useful metadata to help both the client
and the server solve problems. This is often in the response body, using JSON or
whatever data format the API generally uses.

=== Error Objects

A well designed API error will have at the very least:

- A 4xx or 5xx status code depending on the situation
- A human readable short summary: `Cannot checkout with an empty shopping cart`
- A human readable message: `It looks like you have tried to check out but there is nothing in your...`
- An application-specific error code relating to the problem: `ERRCARTEMPTY`
- Links to a documentation page or knowledge base where a client or user of the client can figure out what to do next

This will help humans and machines to figure out what is happening. Missing out
the error code means clients need to implement substring matching, which is
awful for everyone, and turns contents of the error message into part of the
agree contract. Imagine a text-change breaking integration with multiple unknown
clients! üò≥

This used to happen with Facebook and their rather bad Graph API, where any issue
with an access token would return type: `OAuthException`, regardless of the type
of issue. If it was an expired token which needed a refresh, or if it was just
total nonsense, you would get the same type, and a different string.

[source,javascript]
----
{
  "error": {
    "type": "OAuthException",
    "message": "Session has expired at unix time 1385243766. The current unix time is 1385848532."
  }
}
----

Without getting too much into Authentication at this point, there are times
where the client would want to take different actions for different errors. For
example, when an access token was previously good but expires, the client wants
to suggest the user try logging in again, or reconnecting their Facebook
account. When the token is just nonsense (a totally invalid token) then a
different action needs to be taken.

These days Facebook have a far more robust error object in their Graph API, with
error codes and even "sub-codes", so the client developer has enough information
to react programmatically to various errors.

.An improved version of that error message, with an error code and a link
[source,javascript]
----
{
  "error": {
    "message": "Message describing the error",
    "type": "OAuthException",
    "code": 190,
    "error_subcode": 460,
    "error_user_title": "A title",
    "error_user_msg": "A message",
    "fbtrace_id": "EJplcsCHuLu"
  }
}
----

They explain the structure of the error object in their documentation.

=== Know Your Audience

Making errors be useful for client users (not just client developers) can be a
powerful thing. Clients can build their interface around the expectation that a
link in an error will help their users out, without needing to know specifically
what the actual error is.

Whenever possible try to avoid creating an API error that you would not want to
show to a user. Often a client will create a filter that checks for certain
errors to do something, and anything left can be thrown up as a generic error
box with the message in it.

Clients doing this help future proof their application. For example, if a new
validation rule pops up they might not have their UI code written to check for
that, but an ugly alert box can pop up with instructions to the user and maybe
that is better than the application just being completely unusable.

Another useful thing to do is put a link for more information.

.Add a href/link/url property to your error object.
[source,javascript]
----
{
  "error": {
    ...
    "href": "http://example.org/docs/errors/#ERR-01234"
  }
}
----

In some instances maybe this more information link points to a blog post or some
documentation which explains that the user should update their application, or
take some other action to resolve the situation, or email somebody, or reset
their password. üëç

// TODO show how to create error codes with logical ranges and grouping and potentially locale based thing too
// https://www.twilio.com/docs/api/errors

=== The Trouble with Custom Error Formats

Everyone starts off building APIs with their own error format. It usually starts
off as just a string.

[source,javascript]
----
{
  "error": "A thing went really wrong"
}
----

Then somebody points out it would be nice to have application codes, and new
versions of the API (or some different APIs built in the same architecture)
start using a slightly modified format.

[source,javascript]
----
{
  "error": {
    "code": "100110",
    "message": "A thing went really wrong"
  }
}
----

Guess what happens when a client is expecting the first example of a single
string, but ends up getting that second example of an object?

.A wild [object Object] appears on Gelato - a discontinued API design and analytics platform acquimerged into Kong.
image::images/errors-object.jpg[An alert box showing the JavaScript to string representation of an object, instead of the error message.]

These errors happened at WeWork all the time, because every API had a totally
different error format. I remember writing a bunch of code that would check for
various properties, if error is a string, if error is an object, if error is an
object containing foo, if error is an object containing bar....

=== Standard Error Formats

There are two common standards out there for API errors which you should
consider using for your next API, or maybe even consider adding to your existing
APIs.

==== Problem Details for HTTP APIs

https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7807[Problem Details for HTTP APIs (RFC 7807)] is
a brilliant standard from Mark Nottingham and Erik Wilde, released
through the IETF.

[quote,Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF),https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7807]
This document defines a "problem detail" as a way to carry machine-readable
details of errors in a HTTP response to avoid the need to define new error
response formats for HTTP APIs.

The goal of this RFC is to give a standard structure for errors in HTTP APIs
that use JSON (`application/problem+json`) or XML (`application/problem+xml`).

----
HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
Content-Type: application/problem+json
Content-Language: en

{
  "type": "https://example.com/probs/out-of-credit",
  "title": "You do not have enough credit.",
  "detail": "Your current balance is 30, but that costs 50.",
  "instance": "/account/12345/msgs/abc",
  "balance": 30,
  "accounts": ["/account/12345", "/account/67890"]
}
----

This example from the RFC shows the user was forbidden from taking that action,
because the balance did not have enough credit. 403 would not have conveyed that
(it could have meant the user was banned, or all sorts of things) but there is
text, and there is a type, which is just an error code in the form of a URL.

[quote,Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF),https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7807]
____
Note that this requires each of the sub-problems to be similar enough
to use the same HTTP status code. If they do not, the 207 (Multi-
Status) [RFC4918] code could be used to encapsulate multiple status
messages.

A problem details object can have the following members:

- "type" (string) - A URI reference [RFC3986] that identifies the problem type.
This specification encourages that, when dereferenced, it provide human-readable
documentation for the problem type (e.g., using HTML [W3C.REC-html5-20141028]).
When this member is not present, its value is assumed to be "about:blank".

- "title" (string) - A short, human-readable summary of the problem type.  It
SHOULD NOT change from occurrence to occurrence of the problem, except for
purposes of localization (e.g., using proactive content negotiation; see
[RFC7231], Section 3.4).

- "status" (number) - The HTTP status code ([RFC7231], Section 6) generated by
the origin server for this occurrence of the problem.

- "detail" (string) - A human-readable explanation specific to this occurrence
of the problem.

- "instance" (string) - A URI reference that identifies the specific occurrence
of the problem.  It may or may not yield further information if dereferenced.
____

Remembering all of this might be a little tricky, and asking every API developer
to go read and memorize an RFC might not be particularly successful. As with
most things, there are implementations that can be slotted into place for
languages and web application frameworks to make the whole thing easier.

- *PHP:* https://github.com/zendframework/zend-problem-details[zendframework/zend-problem-details]
- *Java:* https://github.com/zalando/problem[problem] & https://github.com/zalando/problem-spring-web[problem-spring-web]
- *Node:* https://www.npmjs.com/package/problem-json
- *Python:* https://github.com/cbornet/python-httpproblem

==== JSON:API

[JSON:API](http://jsonapi.org/format/#errors) is a standard for a lot more than
just errors, it attempts to help with a lot of design choices for HTTP APIs,
outlining the general format of requests and responses in JSON when working with
HTTP APIs. In general it labels itself an anti-bikeshedding tool, and this is
pretty accurate. HTTP API developers often feel like there are infinite
possibilities, which can lead to a lot of discussions and arguments, so using
implementations like JSON:API can get folks on the same page. It will be covered
in a few sections of this book, but for now we can just look at the errors
section.

The following is an excerpt from the JSON:API standard at time of writing.

[quote,JSON:API,https://jsonapi.org/format/#errors]
____
An error object MAY have the following members:

- *"id"* - A unique identifier for this particular occurrence of the problem.
- *"href"* - A URI that MAY yield further details about this particular occurrence of the problem.
- *"status"* - The HTTP status code applicable to this problem, expressed as a string value.
- *"code"* - An application-specific error code, expressed as a string value.
- *"title"* - A short, human-readable summary of the problem. It SHOULD NOT change from occurrence to occurrence of the problem, except for purposes of localization.
- *"detail"* - A human-readable explanation specific to this occurrence of the problem.
- *"links"* - Associated resources, which can be dereferenced from the request document.
- *"path"* - The relative path to the relevant attribute within the associated resource(s). Only appropriate for problems that apply to a single resource or type of resource.

Additional members MAY be specified within error objects.
____

Pretty familiar stuff here! Whilst RFC 7807 has an interface that suggests one
error object be returned with multiple problems provided using extra properties,
JSON:API errors are an array of error objects.

[source,text]
----
HTTP/1.1 422 Unprocessable Entity
Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json

{
  "errors": [
    {
      "source": { "pointer": "/data/attributes/firstName" },
      "title": "Invalid Attribute",
      "detail": "First name must contain at least three characters."
    },
    {
      "source": { "pointer": "/data/attributes/firstName" },
      "title": "Invalid Attribute",
      "detail": "First name must contain an emoji."
    }
  ]
}
----

That "pointer" is a https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901[JSON Pointer (RFC 6901)],
and can be used to point to the specific location in the HTTP request body that
failed.

This is great for client developers who have a UI. They probably already have
some logic which maps their form inputs to request data, so if they use that
pointer they can trace the error back to a form input, and show custom
validation errors even if they had not built that validation into their
frontend.

NOTE: Clients love copying validation rules into their applications and that
leads to all sorts of problems. We will look at how you can avoid that with JSON
Schema later.

There are a lot of https://jsonapi.org/implementations/[implementations for
JSON:API]. To be frank, some are better than others, by which I mean some are
amazing and some are truly terrible. Check a few out.

=== Should You Use a Standard?

RFC 7807 was only released as a final RFC in 2016, and JSON:API is also fairly
recent in the grand schema of the Internet. As such there are not many popular
APIs using them. This is a common stalemate scenario where people do not
implement standards until they see buy-in from a majority of the API community,
or wait for a large company to champion it, and seeing as everyone is waiting
for everyone else to go first nobody does anything. The end result of this
stalemate is that most people roll their own solutions, making a standard less
popular, and the vicious cycle continues.

Many large companies are able to ignore these standards because they can create
their own effective internal standards, and have enough people around with
enough experience to avoid a lot of the common problems around.

Smaller teams that are not in this privileged position, can benefit from
differing to standards written by people who have more context on the task at
hand. If you are Facebook then certainly roll your own error format, but if you
are not then RFC 7807 will point you in the right direction, and implementations
make it easy.

=== 200 OK and Error Code

HTTP 4XX or 5XX codes alert the client, monitoring systems, caching systems, and
all sorts of other network components that something bad happened.

.The folks over at CommitStrip.com know what's up.
image::images/errors-200-ok.jpeg[This monster has got his API responding with HTTP Status 200 OK despite the request failing.]

If you return an HTTP status code of 200 with an error code, then Chuck Norris
will roundhouse your door in, destroy your computer, instantly 35-pass wipe your
backups, cancel your Dropbox account, and block you from GitHub.

=== Non-Existent, Gone, or Hiding?

404 is drastically overused in APIs. People use it for "never existed", "no
longer exists", "you can't view it" and "deactivated", which is way too
vague. That can be split up into 403, 404 and 410 but this is still vague.

If you get a 403, this could be because the requesting user is not in the
correct group to see the requested content. Should the client suggest you
upgrade your account somehow? Are you not friends with the user whose content
you are trying to view? Should the client suggest you add them as a friend?

A 410 on a resource could be due to a user deleting that entire piece of
content, or it could be down to the user deleting their entire account.

=== GraphQL

GraphQL has an error object format defined, so no choice needs to go into
selecting one. It has a message and a location, the location being useful for
GraphIQL and other visual query tools to help show which line the error was on.

[source,javascript]
----
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "Field \"name\" must not have a selection since type \"String!\" has no subfields.",
      "locations": [
        {
          "line": 4,
          "column": 10
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
----

There is also a `path` property made available in some error responses:

[source,text]
----
"path": [
  "name"
],
----

At first this may appear to be similar to the JSON:API pointer (JSON Pointer)
approach, but is actually considerably more complex.

[source,Lee Byron,https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec]
____
If an error can be associated to a particular field in the GraphQL result, it
must contain an entry with the key `path` that details the path of the
response field which experienced the error. This allows clients to identify
whether a `null` result is intentional or caused by a runtime error.

This field should be a list of path segments starting at the root of the
response and ending with the field associated with the error. Path segments
that represent fields should be strings, and path segments that
represent list indices should be 0-indexed integers. If the error happens
in an aliased field, the path to the error should use the aliased name, since
it represents a path in the response, not in the query.

For example, if fetching one of the friends' names fails in the following
query:

  {
    hero(episode: $episode) {
      name
      heroFriends: friends {
        id
        name
      }
    }
  }

The response might look like:

  {
    "errors": [
      {
        "message": "Name for character with ID 1002 could not be fetched.",
        "locations": [ { "line": 6, "column": 7 } ],
        "path": [ "hero", "heroFriends", 1, "name" ]
      }
    ],
    "data": {
      "hero": {
        "name": "R2-D2",
        "heroFriends": [
          {
            "id": "1000",
            "name": "Luke Skywalker"
          },
          {
            "id": "1002",
            "name": null
          },
          {
            "id": "1003",
            "name": "Leia Organa"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
____


As you might have noticed here, GraphQL has an interesting spin on errors. With
most HTTP APIs you are either trying to do something and succeed, or you fail,
and it is usually rather binary.

NOTE: An exception to that rule might be trying to fetch a collection of things,
searching, etc. and getting an empty result, but that is not an error, that is a
fetch returning an empty result.

GraphQL has a different take, and it tries to provide as much data back even
when a request contained incorrectness. It usually seems more like GraphQL considers
errors to be merely warnings, which is why you can have data and also have errors, and
that not be an issue.

When trying to work out where people should put their own errors, there are a
lot of disparate instructions. Some folks saying things like:

[source,Matt Krick,https://itnext.io/the-definitive-guide-to-handling-graphql-errors-e0c58b52b5e1]
____
If the viewer should see the error, include the error as a field in the response payload. For example, if someone uses an expired invitation token and you want to tell them the token expired, your server shouldn‚Äôt throw an error during resolution. It should return its normal payload that includes the error field. It can be as simple as a string or as complicated as you desire:

  return {
    error: {
      id: '123',
      type: 'expiredToken',
      subType: 'expiredInvitationToken',
      message: 'The invitation has expired, please request a new one',
      title: 'Expired invitation',
      helpText: 'https://yoursite.co/expired-invitation-token',
      language: 'en-US'
    }
  }
____

This is back to creating custom error formats, despite GraphQL having one bundled... Not sure. Accepting feedback on best practices if anyone finds them before this book goes to print.

// TODO PRINT best practices for custom errors? maybe talk about apollo again?
// Yup, the answer is apollo again: https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/features/errors
=== gRPC

gRPC does not care about how you do errors, do what you want. The official documentation for gRPC Core has written down some https://grpc.io/grpc/core/md_doc_statuscodes.html[pre-defined error codes], but you can invent your own too.

The official documentation pushes readers towards http://avi.im/grpc-errors/,
which is a convenient set of SDKs for most of the programming languages gRPC is
implemented in. The code helps API developers use the status codes defined in
gRPC Core, and add their own text too.

// There are cases where you're trying to read from multiple sources, and you want best-effort on the results. Transactions are certainly a concern, but orthogonal.
// Phil

// Still not sure what this means. If you‚Äôre trying to make a composite resource from two remote data sources then the data response is just gonna have less data in it if it doesn‚Äôt matter, or fail with error code if it does

// So 200 would cover the first of those two cases, right?

// Hrm, the original tweet made me think that you wouldn‚Äôt like that (it‚Äôs what GraphQL encourages). Sufficiently-ok response is 200 with a data key, but also errors so the client can react appropriately.
// Phil

// It depends on your intent. If the intent of /foo is to show data, and some of that data is optional, then /foo is fine without some of it by definition. That‚Äôs 200 OK.

// If that data is not optional then the whole thing fails.

// I wouldn‚Äôt design like this. It‚Äôs your use case. :)
// Phil

// For example, /users/fred hits a local DB and a PII API to get emails, etc. If PII server is down then this is a failure and 5XX.

// If there‚Äôs some related data like this users likes, recommendations, or whatever unrequited optional related data, I would make that it‚Äôs own resource
// Phil

// Imagine it like a human conversation. In my original example of payments.
