= Introduction

When I was younger and dumber, the planning stage for APIs was pretty much
"think of a list of endpoints then start coding". This is wildly insufficient.
As the "API Descriptions" chapter explained, descriptions are incredibly important
throughout the life-cycle of an API.

The information provided in _Part One: Theory_ is going to come in useful for
this section, as we go through the actual planning of an API. During this
process we will plan an API properly, instead of doing the cowboy nonsense I
used to get up to.

The planning and design phase of an API is intended to do two things:

1. Make developers think really hard about the requirements for their API
2. Gather feedback from client application developers
3. Use the feedback to improve the planning before the development phase begins

== Time is Money

Poorly planned APIs waste a lot of time. Developers cost money, so paying extra
money for developers to rewriting a bunch of code they wrote just recently due
to some oversight is a cost most companies would like to avoid. I've seen APIs
go from v1 to v2 in the first few months, because the developers handed over a
finished product which might have been ok for one client, but caused some issues
for another client.

If that client had been involved earlier on then a solution could have been
found to satisfy the needs of both clients, and the v1 could have been used for
both. Now we've got two separate versions of the API being used at the same
time, with developers maintaining two code paths, and at some point the original
client using the original version of the API is going to have to rewrite their
code to use the newer version of the API. What a daft mess.

== Gather Feedback Early

If clients had more insight into the planning of the API, they have a much
better chance of catching out issues earlier on. We can give them fake API
implementations to work with (these are called "Mocks" or "Mock Servers"), and
when these are based on API descriptions the mocks are generated with minimal
effort from API developers.

Making a few tweaks to the API description documents is much easier than
rewriting a prototype and all of the tests that go with it, and is infinitely
easier than deprecating and removing code that has already made it to
production.

This is much closer to the Agile workflow, instead of the Waterfall model.
Waterfall is junk for API development.

So, you are sold that API descriptions are the way to go, you've picked your
paradigm (and possibly an implementation too), and now you want to start writing
down what the actual API is going to look like.

You might not want to start typing special YAML/JSON/Protobuf blindly into an
empty text file. This has been used as an argument against API descriptions for a
very long time, but it has never been true. We can use text-based or visual
editors, which have special knowledge of these description formats, to speed up
the development of our descriptions!
