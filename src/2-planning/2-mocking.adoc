= Mocking

Mocking in relation to APIs is a really simple idea, and that is to create a
fake API before building the real one. The basic concepts were mentioned in the
introduction, but primarily this is about getting feedback early, allowing you
to tweak and change your way to a solution which is hopefully well suited for
your clients. Folks scoff at this and say "You can never get things perfect",
but you can absolutely cut out a lot back and forth and dodge a few daft
mistakes by putting in some time first.

The term "mock" for a lot of developers will have unit-testing connotations. In
unit-testing, a mock is a fake implementation of a class or function, which
accepts the same arguments as the real thing. It might return something pretty
similar to expected output, and different test cases might even modify those
returns to see how the code under test works.

This is almost exactly the concept here, just at a HTTP level instead. This is
done using a "mock server", which will respond to the expected endpoints, error
for non-existent endpoints, often even provide realistic validation errors if a
client sends it a nonsense request.

== The Most Basic Mock Server EVER

There are a lot of ways to create a mock server, but the most simple mock server
around is https://github.com/typicode/json-server[JSON Server]. This thing is
very handy for quickly getting a HTTP server spitting out some JSON that you
control:

.Woah what a surprise, another NPM tool!
[source,bash]
----
$ npm install -g json-server
----

Then you create a `db.json` file with some data in there:

[source,javascript]
----
{
  "posts": [
    { "id": 1, "title": "json-server", "author": "typicode" }
  ],
  "comments": [
    { "id": 1, "body": "some comment", "postId": 1 }
  ],
  "profile": { "name": "typicode" }
}
----

Now, get that server started via the CLI.

[source,bash]
----
$ json-server --watch db.json
----

When browsing to `http://localhost:3000/posts/1` you will see the following JSON:

[source,javascript]
----
{ "id": 1, "title": "json-server", "author": "typicode" }
----

Boom. A mock server.

You can host that server somewhere simple (shove it on Heroku, Amazon EC2,
etc.), or you can use https://my-json-server.typicode.com/[My JSON Server] - the
hosted version from the same author.

Now, at this point you are probably thinking: "That's lovely and all, but
maintaining that one JSON file is going to be a freaking nightmare!"

Yup. Adding a single property to a resource means you are going to have to go
through each record in `db.json`. Beyond that, formatting the file can turn into
a pain in the ass, conflicts will be rife as the file grows and different
developers add different properties, etc. It's good for quick and dirty demos,
but is probably not something you will want to use in anger.

How about instead of manually maintaining `db.json`, a tool could be pointed at
API descriptions, and a mock server was automagically created?! Then it could
figure out its own examples based on the examples/default values supplied in the
description, and if the description format has validation rules it could even
apply those too!

Thankfully loads of folks in the API ecosystem thought about this, and there is a wide selection of tooling.

== Hosted Editors Love Mock Servers

Most of the hosted editors covered so far have mock servers built in, and often
it is either a case of enabling it, or it is already enabled and you just need
to find the URL to the server instance.

== Standard HTTP Mocking

=== Hosted Mock Servers

https://swagger.io/tools/swaggerhub/[SwaggerHub]

http://stoplight.io/[Stoplight]

// TODO Maybe I'll add https://getsandbox.com/ but yesterday on a github issue they thanks somebody for reminding them OpenAPI v3.0 existed and its 2019!

// TODO creators of wiremock have a thing http://get.mocklab.io/ - import "swagger" and integrates with swaggerhub

=== Free/Open-Source Tools

http://stoplight.io/platform/prism/[Prism]

https://github.com/danielgtaylor/apisprout[API Sprout]

As always check https://openapi.tools/[OpenAPI.Tools] for the latest offering of
mocking tools.

// TODO Can JSON Schema do a decent mock?
// https://www.npmjs.com/package/mock-json-schema
// https://www.npmjs.com/package/cast-with-schema

== GraphQL Mocking

https://app.graphqleditor.com/[GraphQL Editor Cloud]

https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphql-tools/mocking.html[Apollo - GraphQL Tools]

== gRPC Mocking

gRPC has two mocking tools which require a bit more setup. They seem to be more useful for unit/integration testing than helping at a planning stage. We will look at testing in later sections.

// TODO can these be used for mock servers like the above? https://github.com/YoshiyukiKato/grpc-mock
// https://github.com/jekiapp/gripmock

== Interacting with this Mock

Interacting with a mock server should be incredibly similar to how you would interact with any API. That is the point, after-all.

Find the instance of the mock server, then point your HTTP/GraphQL/gRPC client at it.

// TODO Totally phoned this in but im tired of talking about mocking. Show real examples with prism.

== Next

Hopefully you have managed to get a mock server running for your API descriptions, and can interact with it.
