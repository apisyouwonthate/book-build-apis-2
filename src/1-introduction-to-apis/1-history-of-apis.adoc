= A History of APIs

Back in the early days of web APIs, things were a lot more rigid. Around the
late 90s and early 2000s, most web services relied on XML-based protocols like
XML-RPC and SOAP. XML-RPC was pretty straightforward—it let you make remote
procedure calls using XML over HTTP. But then came SOAP, which was way more
structured, with strict schemas defined by WSDL (Web Services Description
Language). It had built-in security, error handling, and a whole bunch of
enterprise-level features, but man, it was heavy. Lots of boilerplate, lots of
XML, and it just felt bloated, especially when you were dealing with simple
requests. But big enterprises loved it because it had all these guarantees
around messaging and security.  

Then in 2000, Roy Fielding dropped his dissertation introducing REST
(Representational State Transfer), and everything changed. REST wasn't a
protocol like SOAP—it was more of an architectural style that embraced the web's
existing HTTP model. Instead of complicated XML payloads, REST used simple HTTP
methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE, and it wasn't tied to XML. Once JSON
became more popular (lighter than XML, easier for JavaScript to handle), REST
APIs really took off. By the 2010s, platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and Google
were all using REST, and it became the gold standard for APIs.  

But then people started running into some issues. One big one was over-fetching
and under-fetching—REST endpoints return fixed data structures, so sometimes
you'd get way more data than you needed, or you'd have to make multiple requests
to piece together the right data. This concern was especially relevant during
the HTTP/1.1 era, where multiple requests could be slow due to the head-of-line
blocking problem, so minimizing requests was key at that time.

Facebook came up with GraphQL in 2015 to solve some of these issues. Instead of
fixed endpoints, GraphQL lets clients ask for exactly the data they need and
nothing more. It also lets you fetch related data in a single request, so no
more chaining multiple REST calls. This was a game changer for front-end
development, especially for mobile apps where you wanted to minimize network
calls. But GraphQL isn't a replacement for REST—it just solves different
problems. Some people love it, others find it overcomplicated, especially when
dealing with caching and performance at scale.  

Then there's gRPC, which came out of Google. Instead of using HTTP's standard
text-based model, gRPC is all about efficiency—it uses Protocol Buffers
(protobufs) instead of JSON, and it's built on HTTP/2, which supports things
like multiplexing (sending multiple requests at once over a single connection).
gRPC is great for internal microservices because it's super fast and has
built-in support for streaming, but it's not as web-friendly as REST or GraphQL.  

HTTP/2 brought similar performance improvements to REST, meaning some of the
concerns that had people looking at alternatives like GraphQL and gRPC were less
pressing.

REST is still the dominant style for public APIs, GraphQL has carved
out a strong niche where flexible queries are needed (like frontend-heavy
applications), and gRPC is thriving in backend and microservices environments
where performance is critical. There's no “winner” here—just different tools for
different jobs.
