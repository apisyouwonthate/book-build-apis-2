= How to read this book

The book has been designed to be read in a linear fashion, slowly building up your understanding of APIs. Each chapter builds on the previous one; however, we start each chapter with a short introduction to give you an idea of what you will learn. 

If you are already familiar with APIs, you can read the introduction and decide if you want to skip the chapter. A lot has changed in the world of APIs in the last few years, so even if you are familiar with APIs, re-covering the basics might be helpful. Repetition is vital to learning. Think of it like athletes who practice the same moves repeatedly to get better. Re-doing the basics is never a bad thing.

We have tried to avoid too many code examples, especially early in the book, as we want to focus on the concepts and ideas behind APIs.
