## Authentication

1. What is auth
    1. Why you need it (it's really not optional)     
2. So if that’s getting auth wrong, why do we even need auth in the first place?  
   1. Why ip addresses don’t work  
   2. What you are trying to protect against  
   3. Why you always need it  
3. Adding login: your options \- pros and cons, How do I even?  
   1. SDKs  
   2. Open Source  
   3. Third parties  
   4. Do it my self…Oh that’s easy to get right, right?  
4. Picking the right solution \=\> What are the User Stories  
   1. Right person right access (what’s in our blog on the reasons why?)  
   2. Now share the different kinds of access  
      1. User auth \- Social/Federated Auth  
      2. Businesses and corporate IdP source of truth  
      3. Machine to Machine authentication \- Microservices  
      4. Users have different access permissions to the same resource  
5. Getting technical \- API Design in practice  
   1. Authentication is what happens in your UI \- There is no backend component  
   2. App redirects  
   3. Access tokens, refresh tokens, API keys  
   4. Verifying tokens  
   5. Sessions  
   6. Offline Silent Authentication  
6. Risks and common pitfalls: What we can’t do  
   1. OWASP  
      1. Getting Auth wrong biggest two problems  
      2. The top two OWASP security vulnerabilities are Broken Authentication and Broken Object Level Authorization. OWASP is…  
   2. Things that shouldn’t be done:  
      1. Passwords are dead  
      2. MFA over SMS (show AiTM attacks)  
      3. MFA over TOTP is dead (show AiTM attacks)  
      4. Magic Links are dead  
      5. Captua is dead  
      6. Session Based Auth  
      7. Backend Authentication flow  
7. Technology deep dive  
   1. Authentication Server  
      1. Called OAuth Authorization Server  
      2. Types of Signatures Algorithms  
      3. SAML  
      4. OpenID  
      5. AD, LDAP, Keberos  
   2. Yubikeys  
      1. Passkeys  
      2. FIDO2  
      3. WebAuthn  
   3. Token Types  
      1. Access Token  
      2. Identity Token  
      3. Refresh Tokens  
8. Interacting with user data owned in other services  
   1. Credential Management  
   2. Consent Screen  
9. Closing statement: login is the first step. Next \- permissions.  
   1. Do I include this here if so how deep should I go?  
   2. Roles, Resources, types of access control  
   3. When to access control  
   4. etc….
