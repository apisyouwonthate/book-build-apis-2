Best practices and common patterns for API requests.

Understanding how to properly structure and handle request data is crucial for building robust APIs. This guide covers best practices and common patterns for working with API request data.

== URL Structure

Every API request starts with a URL that identifies the resource and any query parameters:

{lang=http}
~~~~~~~~
GET /api/v1/places?lat=40.759211&lon=-73.984638 HTTP/1.1
Host: api.example.org
~~~~~~~~

Key components:

* Resource path: Identifies what you're interacting with.
* Query parameters: Filter, sort, or modify the request.
* API version: Often included in the path.

== Request Bodies

Requests can also have a 'request body', which is a payload of data being sent
the API for processing. It is very frowned upon for `GET` but expected for
`POST`, `PUT`, and `PATCH`. The request body can be in a variety of formats, but
the most common are JSON, XML, and form data.

{lang=http}
~~~~~~~~
POST /places HTTP/1.1
Host: api.example.org
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "High Wood",
  "lat": 50.464569783,
  "lon": -4.486597585
}
~~~~~~~~

This `POST` request to the `/places` endpoint is trying to add a new place to
the API, once again using a JSON body. The `Content-Type` header lets the server
know to expect JSON data, so it can parse the body and create a new place with
the name "High Wood" and the coordinates `50.464569783, -4.486597585`.

So far the examples of HTTP requests and responses have been using text, but in
reality they are just a series of bytes. The text is just a human-readable
representation of the bytes, and the tools that interact with the API will
convert the text to bytes before sending it, and convert the bytes back to text
when receiving it.

Most of you will interact with APIs using a programming language, and the code
to send a request will look something like this:

[tabs]
====
TypeScript::
+
{lang=typescript}
~~~~~~~~
import axios from 'axios';

const response = await axios.post('https://api.example.org/places', {
  name: 'High Wood',
  lat: 50.464569783,
  lon: -4.486597585,
});
~~~~~~~~

Python::
+
{lang=python}
~~~~~~~~
import json
import requests

headers = {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
}
payload = {
    'name': 'High Wood',
    'lat': 50.464569783,
    'lon': -4.486597585,
}
req = requests.post(
  'https://api.example.org/places',
  data=json.dumps(payload),
  headers=headers
)
~~~~~~~~

PHP::
+
{lang=php}
~~~~~~~~
$client = new Guzzle\Http\Client('https://api.example.org');

$headers = [
    'Content-Type' => 'application/json',
];
$payload = [
    'name' => 'High Wood',
    'lat' => 50.464569783,
    'lon' => -4.486597585,
];
$req = $client->post('/places', [
  'headers' => $headers,
  'json' => $payload,
]);
~~~~~~~~

Ruby::
+
{lang=ruby}
~~~~~~~~
conn = Faraday.new(
  url: 'https://api.example.org',
  headers: { 'Content-Type' => 'application/json' }
)

response = conn.post('/places') do |req|
  req.body = {
    name: 'High Wood',
    lat: 50.464569783,
    lon: -4.486597585,
  }.to_json
end
~~~~~~~~
====

HTTP tooling is essentially the same thing no matter the language. It's all
about URLs, methods, body, and headers. This makes REST API design a lot easier,
as you have a "uniform interface" to work with, whether everything is following
all these set conventions already.

Requests like `POST`, `PUT`, and `PATCH` typically include data in their body.

{lang=http}
~~~~~~~~
POST /places HTTP/1.1
Host: api.example.org
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "High Wood",
  "lat": 50.464569783,
  "lon": -4.486597585
}
~~~~~~~~

This area is yours to do with as you want. There's a lot of freedom in how you
structure your data, but there are some best practices to follow which you can
learn more about in the xref:api-collections[API Collections & Resources] guide.

=== Request Body

The request is body is where the majority of "domain specific" data (things
specifically about your organization or API) will go. To understand more about
request bodies, we need to learn about data formats.

== Best Practices

=== 1. Keep Request & Response Data Consistent

Maintain the same structure for data going in and out of your API. You want to
strive for predictability and consistency in your API design. When a user sends
a `POST` request to create a new resource, they should get back a response that
looks like the resource they just created. If a user updates a resource, the
response should return the new state of the updated resource.

{lang=json}
~~~~~~~~
// POST Request
{
  "name": "High Wood",
  "lat": 50.464569783,
  "lon": -4.486597585
}

// Response
{
  "id": 123,
  "name": "High Wood",
  "lat": 50.464569783,
  "lon": -4.486597585,
  "created_at": "2024-10-24T12:00:00Z"
}
